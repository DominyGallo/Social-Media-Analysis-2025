1. Afghanistan’s National Circumstances and Commitment to Climate Change 
Introduction 
Afghanistan has extensive development and climate adaptation needs and, currently, low levels of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world today, 
with an estimated population of 28.6 million (2015)1 and a per capita GDP of USD 660.2  
 
 
Afghanistan is highly prone to natural disasters throughout its 34 provinces.3 As a result of climate change, 
it is anticipated that the incidence of extreme weather events, including heat waves, floods, and droughts 
will likely increase, as will climate change-linked disasters such as glacial lake outflows. The majority of 
Afghanistan’s population relies directly or indirectly on the available natural resources for their livelihoods 
so with these climatic changes the foundation of the country’s economy, stability, and food security is 
under threat. 
 
Despite these challenges, Afghanistan can remain a low emission economy while developing rapidly if, 
under the Paris Climate Change Agreement, extensive financial and other resources are made available to 
allow Afghanistan to successfully develop and implement Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) 
and Highly Effective Adaptation and Development Strategies (HEADS).  
 
Appropriate support in the form of finance, capacity building, technology and legal assistance is needed for 
Afghanistan to make substantial progress on social and economic fronts while maintaining low per capita 
GHG emission levels. 
 
Description of Fairness and Ambition 
Afghanistan recognizes that all countries in the world need to make rapid progress towards lowering, or 
maintaining if already low, per capita emission levels to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. It is 
therefore critical that under the Paris Agreement, financial resources, capacity building, technology 
transfer, and other support is provided to Afghanistan in order to enable it to implement LEDS and 
HEADS. This will allow Afghanistan to continue developing while maintaining low level of emissions and 
increasing adaptive capacity to climate change.  
 
There would be lower costs and a clearer development path for Afghanistan if it pursued development 
using mainly fossil fuels, as other countries have. This would likely result in GHG emission in Afghanistan 
continuing to increase at current rates for the period to 2025 and beyond. However, given the extremely 
limited remaining global GHG emissions budget, Afghanistan requires the UNFCCC, the Global 
Environmental Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and other international institutional 
arrangements to provide the extra finance and other support needed to successfully implement LEDS across 
all sectors of its economy without compromising socio-economic development goals.   
 
National Development Objectives 
Despite suffering decades of instability and war, Afghanistan has made considerable development progress. 
Over the past 13 years notable achievements have been made in the areas of environment, agriculture, 
health, education, infrastructure, the economy, and the provision of other important basic services.4 
 
Afghanistan’s National Development Strategy (ANDS) is based on Afghanistan’s Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). It identifies the environment as “a cross-cutting issue that underpins the 
entire social and economic development framework for the country.” The National Environment Protection 
Agency (NEPA), mandated to address environmental concerns, continues to work with all parts of the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to mainstream environmental and climate

change considerations into the country’s national development framework. NEPA advocates for 
appropriate policies and measures that enable rapid development while ensuring good environmental and 
climate change outcomes. Afghanistan has developed its INDC with the conviction that countering the 
effects of climate change requires a commitment from all countries with regard to mitigation, and 
adaptation. 
 
In terms of international commitments on climate change, Afghanistan joined the UNFCCC in 1992, and 
ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2013. Afghanistan completed its National Adaptation Programmes of Action 
for Climate Change (NAPA) and National Capacity Needs Self-assessment for Global Environmental 
Management (NCSA) in 2009. Afghanistan submitted its Initial National Communication (INC) under the 
UNFCCC in 2012, and is currently preparing its Second National Communication (SNC) for submission to 
the UNFCCC in 2016. At present, Afghanistan is finalizing its national Climate Change Strategy and 
Action Plan (ACCSAP) as well as its National Adaptation Plan (NAP). 
 
In 2015, as part of the INDC preparation process, NEPA convened a series of consultation and awareness-
raising workshops to bring together decision-makers from government institutions and stakeholders from 
non-governmental organizations to develop the current INDC and establish a sustainable development 
vision for Afghanistan. Through this INDC process and existing policies and strategies, the overall vision 
that was developed for Afghanistan aims to enhance the adaptive capacity and resilience of its agriculture, 
environment, and population to climate change, while developing and implementing LEDS.  
 
Climate Change Trends, Impacts, and Vulnerabilities 
Afghanistan is ranked among the most vulnerable countries in the world to the adverse impacts of climate 
change.5 Afghanistan’s INC report has documented an increase of 0.6°C in the country’s mean annual 
temperature since 1960. Based upon recent climate observations, precipitation patterns have decreased 
during springtime (March-May) by approximately 40.5mm; however, the total annual precipitation has 
only slightly decreased by approximately 30mm since there is a slight increase in precipitation from June 
until November. This implies that Afghanistan is already beginning to experience the initial adverse 
impacts of climate change.  
 
Recent climate projections, based on Cordex regional climate models and representative concentration 
pathways (RCPs)6, indicate that Afghanistan will face an overall strong increase in mean annual 
temperature, considerably higher than global mean projections, when compared to a baseline period of 
1986-2006. More specifically, under the “optimistic” scenario (RCP4.5), the mean of the model ensembles 
projects a warming of approximately 1.5°C until 2050 and of approximately 2.5°C until 2100. For the 
“pessimistic” scenario (RCP8.5), the models project an extreme warming of approximately 3°C until 2050, 
with further warming up to 7°C by 2100. Under both scenarios there are regional differences, with a higher 
temperature increases at higher altitudes compared to the lowlands.  
 
For precipitation a significant (α=0.05) mean decrease of precipitation during springtime (March-May) for 
the North, the Central Highlands and the East for both scenarios from 2006 until 2050 between 5-10 
percent is seen. This decrease is offset by a slight increase of precipitation during autumn and wintertime 
(October-December) in these regions. For the Hindu Kush area, a significant and substantial increase in 
precipitation during the winter season of approximately 10 percent is seen, whereas during spring season 
precipitation is projected to stay stable. For the arid South of the country, the models do not project 
significant trends for precipitation. The decrease of precipitation during spring is particularly relevant since 
during these months the main plant growth for agricultural production takes place. In addition, the decrease 
                                                 
5 DARA Climate Vulnerability Monitor (2012); GermanWatch Global Climate Risk Index (2013); and Notre 
Dame Global Adaptation Index (2014). 
6 Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are GHG emission scenarios adopted by the IPCC to describe 
four possible climate futures depending on the levels of future global GHGs emitted. There are four RCPs: 1) 
RCP2.6, which assumes that GHG emissions peak between 2010-2020 and then decline; 2) RCP4.5, which 
assumes that GHG emissions peak around 2040 and then decline; 3) RCP6, which assumes that GHG emissions 
peak around 2080 and then decline; and 4) RCP8.5, which assumes that GHGs emissions continue to rise 
throughout the 21st century.

is projected to take place in the regions with the highest agricultural productivity of Afghanistan (East, 
North, and Central Highlands). In combination with the overall increase in temperature and the related 
increase in evapotranspiration across the country, this will most likely negatively impact the hydrological 
cycle, agricultural productivity, and availability of water resources. Climatic changes are also likely to 
impact upon the spread of water, food and vector-borne diseases, presenting considerable health risks to 
both urban and rural populations. Finally, the aforementioned climate-induced risks and challenges can 
enhance social inequalities, poverty, and food insecurity causing considerable and fundamental threats to 
human life, livelihoods, property, political stability, the economy, and the environment in Afghanistan. 
 
Based upon these climate change projections, Afghanistan’s environment will experience considerable 
changes over the remainder of this century. Climate change, based on sound scientific analysis of climatic 
changes and uncertainties, must be mainstreamed into sectoral planning to reduce the negative impacts of 
climate change in Afghanistan and increase resilience, both in rural and urban areas.  
 
2. Climate Change Adaptation 
Near- and Long-term Adaptation Visions, Goals and Targets 
 
Afghanistan’s vision for addressing the adverse impacts of climate change through adaptation aims to 
protect the country and its population by enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience, effectively respond to 
the vulnerabilities of critical sectors, and efficiently mainstream climate change considerations into national 
development policies, strategies, and plans. In order to achieve this vision, a national strategy for climate 
change adaptation must include community level vulnerabilities and build up their adaptive capacities by 
investment in short- and long-term initiatives. Short-term action plans formed part of the 2009 NAPA, 
while the NAP will implement both short- and long-term priorities These priorities include, but are not 
limited to:  
1. Reducing vulnerability of the country and its population through enhancement of adaptive capacity 
and resilience, and deployment of disaster risk reduction approaches  
2. Integrating climate change consideration into the national planning processes 
3. Promoting economic development and sustainable rural livelihoods through sustainable 
management of environmental resources and increase access to modern forms of efficient and 
sustainable energy services 
4. Improvement of technical capacity in governmental institutions 
5. Adaptive and integrated land and water management  
6. Improving access by rural communities and farmers to water to support food security, reduce 
poverty and improve agricultural productions 
7. Raising awareness for people of Afghanistan on climate change impacts and adaptation measures  
 
Current Adaptation Undertakings and Support 
 
Afghanistan has initiated a number of steps to promote the country’s sustainable development. In term of 
national development policies, plans, and legal frameworks, considerable effort has been placed on 
addressing environmental challenges, disaster risk reduction, food security, water security, protection of 
forest and rangelands, and biodiversity conservation, all of which have clear relevance to climate change 
adaptation. Some noteworthy examples of such policies and plans that have successfully and explicitly 
integrated climate change include:  
 
 
Afghanistan National Renewable Energy Policy (ANREP) 
 
National Water and Natural Resource Management Priority Programme 
 
Strategic National Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction (SNAP) 
 
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) 
 
National Comprehensive Agriculture Production and Market Development Programme 
 
Energy for Rural Development (ERDA) 
 
National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) 
 
5 
 
 
Additional national development policies, strategies, and plans that currently do not mention climate 
change but have entry points for the further mainstreaming of climate change include:  
 
 
National Agricultural Development Framework (NADF) 
 
National Environment Strategy 
 
Energy Sector Strategy 
 
National Forestry Management Plan 
 
Rangeland Management Plan 
 
Strategic Policy Framework for the Water Sector 
 
In term of programmes and projects, support provided by the international community and multilateral 
agencies have laid the groundwork for building Afghanistan’s adaptive capacity and resilience to climate 
change. Major contributors include the Tokyo Framework bilateral partners, Global Environmental Facility 
(GEF), which has provided support through enabling activities, mid-size projects, and full-size climate 
change adaptation projects funded by the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), as well as bilateral 
donors, non-governmental organizations, and the United Nations. With the scale and urgency of 
Afghanistan’s adaptation needs, additional financial and other resources are strongly needed in order to 
effectively build the adaptive capacity and resilience of the country and its people before more severe 
impacts of climate change begin to be felt. 
 
Adaptation Needs and Means of Implementation (MOI) 
 
Afghanistan faces a number of specific challenges in terms of addressing climate change through 
adaptation. These challenges include, but are not limited to, funding gaps, lack of expertise, lack of reliable 
historical climate data, weak public awareness about environmental issues, and security. Afghanistan has 
identified the following key actions as part of its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) in order to overcome 
existing gaps and barriers towards sufficiently addressing its climate change adaptation needs. The total 
estimated cost of full implementation of the NAP is USD10.785 billion over ten years.

3. Climate Change Mitigation 
 
GHG Emissions and Mitigation Measures 
Afghanistan has very low relative per capita GHG emissions. While 1990 emissions were at 0.2 metric tons 
CO2 per capita, data indicates that per capita emissions were around 0.3 for 2010, making Afghanistan one 
of the lowest GHG emitters globally.7 However, the country is on a growth path, which is expected to 
strengthen over the coming years, meaning GHG emissions are likely to increase. It is important that 
support be provided to Afghanistan to develop LEDS to minimize the increase in its GHG emissions. 
 
Afghanistan’s overall GHG emission figures (Table 1) demonstrate that the most important sources of CO2 
emissions are from the “Land-Use Change and Forestry” and “Energy” sectors.8 In terms of CH4 and N2O 
emissions, the agriculture sector is the major contributor.9 It is therefore important that greater attention 
should be focused on GHG mitigation measures within these sectors. Afghanistan has only started to access 
UNFCCC technology transfer opportunities. It needs to build national capacity to navigate opportunities 
and play a more critical role in international negotiations.  
The following mitigation options are designed to enable Afghanistan to make a mitigation contribution 
which is condition on support needs for financial and technical support being met.

The People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria 
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution 
INDC-ALGERIA 
September 3rd, 2015 
 
1. Preamble  
Algeria, a country severely affected by desertification is- like other countries in Africa 
and in the south of the Mediterranean- particularly vulnerable to the multiform effects 
of climate change that threaten to undermine its economic and social development. 
Respecting its contractual engagements, Algeria renews its commitments to work 
together with the Contracting Parties to achieve the objectives of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). To this end, it reaffirms, at 
the highest level, its willingness to spare no effort for the success of the twenty-first 
session of the Conference of the Parties, to be held in Paris on December 2015. 
Given the climate emergency, Algeria reiterates the need for the adoption in Paris of 
an ambitious and durable agreement on climate change, inspired by the latest scientific 
findings, and centered around the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibility, while taking due consideration of the specific circumstances and 
respective capabilities of the Contracting Parties. It is in this spirit that the present 
provisional contribution, nationally determined, was prepared and submitted by 
Algeria, in accordance with the relevant provisions of decisions 1/CP 19 and 1/CP 20 
of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC.  
This provisional contribution concerns the two equally important pillars of the 
UNFCCC; namely, the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and adaptation 
to climate change impacts.  
As a developing country, Algeria has no historical responsibility in terms of 
accumulation of greenhouse gases. Being a low GHG-emitting country, its current 
responsibility is very limited. In addition, country's socio-economic and 
development needs are continuously increasing in order to meet the legitimate 
expectations of its people, especially its youth. 
 
 
3 
 
The provisional contribution of Algeria is submitted under the condition of access to 
new external financial resources from its bilateral and multilateral partners, as well as 
clean technology transfer on concessional and preferential terms and strengthening its 
technical capabilities.  
This provisional contribution is designed taking into account the particularly difficult 
financial and economic present conditions of Algeria, due to the significant drop in oil 
prices.  
Its final contribution at the time of entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate 
Change will be adjusted accordingly. 
Algeria’s INDC covers the 2021-2030 period. It involves mainly the sectors of energy, 
industry, transport, agriculture and forestry, construction and the environment. Algeria 
will submit its final contribution at the time of ratification of the Paris agreement, 
before its intended entry into force in 2020. 
2. The INDC preparation framework  
Following the adoption of decision 1/ CP20 on December 2014 that defined the 
framework of the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, Algeria launched a 
review of its institutional and regulatory framework in the matter of energy efficiency 
and the promotion of new and renewable energy adopted in 2011. 
On February 2015, this review has been finalized and submitted for adoption by the 
Council of Ministers that endorsed it at its meeting on May 24th, 2015. A working 
group on the INDC was established, with the participation of representatives from 14 
ministries and the National Economic and Social Council, and placed under the 
authority of the Minister in charge of environment. The preliminary outcomes of the 
work of that group have been submitted f o r  the consideration and decision of the 
Interministerial Council meeting devoted to the climate issue, held on July 7th, 2015, 
under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. A National Climate Committee (NCC), 
placed under the authority of the Minister in charge of environment, was established. It 
is composed of representatives of relevant governmental departments and the National 
Economic and Social Council. 
The NCC strengthens the institutional framework to ensure coordination, monitoring 
and assessment of national policies and programs on climate change and proposes 
measures to guarantee the implementation of Algeria's commitments in relation to the 
UNFCCC, international institutions and /or decisions on climate change issues. 
At its meeting on July 26th, 2015, chaired by the Minister in charge of environment, 
the NCC finalized the provisional contribution of Algeria.  
4 
 
The INDC of Algeria was developed in an inter-sectorial framework and has greatly 
benefited from the consultation process with stakeholders held at the national level. In 
addition, the National Dialogue Conference on Climate, organized on July 28th, 2015 
was a platform for dialogue and exchanges on Algeria's climate ambitions, with the 
participation of institutional and socio-economic actors, local authorities and business 
organizations, socio-professional associations, environmental protection associations, 
as well as experts, scholars, and representatives of the civil society. Six ministers, four 
of which were represented at the NCC, as well as the President of the National 
Economic and Social Council, have participated in this Conference. 
Within the framework of public awareness chapter, media representatives took also 
part in this meeting, the first of its kind to be held in Algeria, and with more than 500 
participants. Based on this wide consultation, a reviewed version of the Algeria’s 
INDC was submitted for adoption to the Interministerial Council, chaired by the Prime 
Minister, at its meeting on September 3rd, 2015. 
3. National circumstances   
Algeria is an African and a Mediterranean country covering 2 381 741 km2. Like many 
of the countries in its region, Algeria is affected by desertification and land 
degradation. Most of the country is arid or semi- arid. The areas receiving more than 
400 mm of rain per year are located in a narrow strip along the coast, not-exceeding 
150 km large. Moreover, due to climate changes, yearly average rainfall declined by 
more than 30% over the past decades.    
Parallel to the coastline, mountains act as a barrier and accentuate the climate drought 
towards the south of the country. Anthropic effects aggravate those caused by 
geographic characteristics. Indeed, 85 % of the Algerian population lives in the 
northern part of the country. Moreover, land characteristics reduce the possibilities of 
carbon capture in Algeria, when compared to countries with a large vegetal coverage.  
Algeria is facing extreme climate events recrudescence, which accentuates its 
vulnerability. In addition, the recurrence of drought cycles, with longer durations,  
accelerates desertification.  
In fact, more than 50 million of hectares face highly deteriorated conditions. Rural 
population -composed mainly of farmers and breeders- is  forced into exodus to large 
cities, for survival. This situation is the direct result of land impoverishment and the 
decline in water resources.                 
Important programs were launched by public authorities since the seventies. This 
includes the realization of a “great green dam”, a forest cover of 1200 km long and 20 
km large, on average. This achievement constitutes today one of the great prides of our 
country and represents a significant carbon sink. Other big projects were also initiated, 
such the program of pastoral plantation covering thousands of hectares. 
 
5 
 
With regard to floodings, the country is always facing this phenomenon. Several 
regions witnessed tragic events resulting in heavy losses human lives and 
considerable material damages. For example, the 2001 catastrophic floods in Algiers 
resulted in the death of 715 persons and thousands of disaster victims. The recurrent 
floods continue to adversely impact public financial resources. 
Therefore, Algeria is entitled to benefit from the climate international solidarity 
arising from the future Paris agreement. It is particularly vulnerable to greenhouse 
gases accumulation effects, for which it is not in any way responsible, neither in the 
past, nor today or in the future. Natural gas, a cleaner energy than coal, dominates 
Algeria’s energy mix since decades. In this respect, its proven and possible natural 
gas resources shall be able to assist its partners to promote the use of this clean source 
of energy. 
 
Algeria also faces the challenges related to food security, to its ecosystems and 
agriculture resilience, to major risks and to natural resources scarcity. In addition, it 
shall satisfy the expanding needs of its growing population, in terms of employment, 
education, health and housing, while the economic and financial environment is 
aggravated by the significant drop in oil prices.   
It should be noted as well that Algeria is already contributing for several decades in 
the mitigation efforts through its energy mix, based essentially on natural gas. The 
development of its electricity generation capacity is largely based on combined-cycle 
power plants. A hybrid power plant, combining solar energy and natural gas, is already 
operational. Besides, Algeria’s efforts to reduce gas flaring emissions are to be 
pursued and sustained.     
4. Mitigation Measures    
Algeria’s mitigation strategy covers mainly energy, forests, housing, transport, 
industry and waste sectors. It is based in particular on the national programs for 
renewable energy and energy efficiency. This reflects its willingness to pursue its 
efforts in combating the adverse impacts of climate change. Such programs shall be 
pursued and sustained so long as Algeria benefits from international support in terms 
of new and external financial resources, and technology transfer, and capacity 
building. 
Algeria’s contribution in mitigation is based on the three most important 
greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide gas (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide 
(N2O).      
At the meeting held on May 24th, 2015, under the chairmanship of His Excellency 
President of the Republic Mr. Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, the Council of Ministers 
adopted the new national programs for renewable energy and energy efficiency. 
These ambitious programs aim at reducing by 9% the global consumption of energy by 
2030. It aims to engage thermal insulation of an important housing program, as well as 
to convert to LPG a million of light-duty vehicles and more than 20.000 buses.       
6 
 
By 2030, it aspires to the deployment, on a large scale, of photovoltaic and wind 
power as well as thermal solar energy, and the integration of cogeneration, biomass 
and geothermal energy. This program ultimately aims to reach the target that 27% of 
the electricity produced nationally is derived from renewable sources of energy. 
In fact, Algeria, being the largest country in Africa, in the Mediterranean and in the 
Arab world, has one of the highest solar deposits in the world, estimated to exceed five 
billion GWh/yr. The annual sunshine duration is estimated to be around 2 500 hours 
on average, and could exceed 3 600 hours in some parts of the country.   
In addition to its 200 thermal cities, Algeria, the tenth largest country in the world, has 
a geothermal reservoir composed of Albian groundwater, which extends over 700 000 
km².  
The action plan of the government aspires also to reduce gas flaring to less than 1%, 
by 2030. 
Regarding methane emissions reduction, Algeria intends to give priority to the 
management of household solid waste, with the objective to achieve, by 2030, a full 
coverage of wastes dumps in its territory.  
Regarding carbon capture, the country aims to accelerate and intensify its National 
Reforestation Plan with a global objective of reforestation of 1 245 000 ha.    
The mitigation actions to be implemented by Algeria, planned for the 2021-2030 
period, will lead to the following contribution:       
 
   
        
  
 
 
The Algerian contribution regarding mitigation is defined as follows: 
Type of INDC: Relative reduction compared to Business as usual (BAU) scenario.     
 
Implementation period: 2021-2030 
 
Methodological approach: combined approach: Bottom-Up concerning sectors and 
Top-Down concerning national objectives. 
 
Sectors covered: Energy (Generation, Transport, Building and Industry); Industrial 
processes; Agriculture, Forests, Land use and Waste.  
 
 
Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions by 7% to 22%, by 2030, compared to a 
business as usual -BAU- scenario, conditional on external support in terms of finance, 
technology development and transfer, and capacity building. The 7% GHG reduction 
will be achieved with national means.       
7 
 
Estimating GHG emissions: Directives of IPCC -2006- and Global Warming 
Potential, as agreed in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report on Climate change.  
 
Coverage of Greenhouse Gases: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous 
Oxide (N2O).

Considerations of fairness and ambition of the INDC based on national 
circumstances 
 
    - Algeria, as a low GHG emitting country, has already invested heavily in 
adaptation  to climate change impacts as well as in mitigation and intends to pursue 
its efforts in this regard; 
 
    - Algeria has been participating since a long period of time in the greenhouse gas 
mitigation, by virtue of its high share of natural gas in its energy mix; 
 
    - The Algerian economy is highly dependent on petroleum export revenues. This 
situation makes Algeria vulnerable to climate change adverse effects, as well as to 
the negative impacts of response measures; 
 
   - Algeria faces significant and growing development and adaptation needs given its 
high population growth, increasing demand for energy, goods and services.  
 
How INDC will contribute to the accomplishment of article 2 of the Convention 
on Climate Change 
 
Through its mitigation actions for by 2030, considering its socio-economic 
development objectives, and taking into account its national circumstances, Algeria 
will contribute, on an equitable basis, to the achievement of the objective of article 2 
of the Convention.  
 
 
5. Adaptation Measures 
Algeria aims to develop a national plan of adaptation to the impacts of climate change 
in the context of the finalization of its contribution, and in order to promote a more 
c l i m a t e  c h a n g e  resilient economy. Priority will be given to the protection of the 
population and the preservation of natural resources and key infrastructure against the 
risks of extreme events. 
The objective of this national plan is: 
- To reinforce the ecosystems resilience (flooding and drought) in order to curtail 
the risks of natural disasters related to climate change; 
- To fight against erosion and rehabilitate its degraded lands as part of t h e  
e f f o r t s  t o  combat desertification ; 
- To integrate the impacts of climate change into sectorial strategies, in particular 
for agriculture, water management, public health and transport; 
- To integrate the impacts of climate change on political stability and national 
security. 
9 
 
The main adaptation measures to be adopted require diversified international support, 
including financing, capacity-building and technology transfer. These adaptation 
measures mentioned in the National Climate Plan are as follows: 
- Adapting the institutional and regulatory framework to climate change; 
- Reinforcing institutional and human capacities in combating climate change; 
- Establishing a monitoring and early warning system and capacity building with 
regard to extreme climate events management; 
- Elaborating regional and local plans for adaptation to climate change. 
6. Planning and Institutional Framework for Implementation 
The provisional intended and nationally determined contribution will be finalized 
between 2016 and 2020 under the authority of the National Climate Committee. It will 
be updated according to the outcomes of the Paris Climate Conference and will take 
into account the financial situation of Algeria at the moment of its finalization.  
It will address quantified greenhouse gas mitigation objectives for the period 2020-
2030, using the methodology developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change. The contribution will be finalized and implemented with the active 
participation of all the actors in the society and, in particular, representatives of the 
civil society, economic actors, representatives of the local authorities and the scientific 
community. 
It will be accompanied by a comprehensive public awareness-raising campaign 
through the media, schools, companies, local collectivities and mosques. In this regard, 
forums on cities and climate change will be set up. 
Algeria’s ambition regarding mitigation and adaptation will be achieved within North-
South and South-South cooperation, with its bilateral and multilateral- traditional and 
new- partners. A group of “Friends of Algeria’s Ambition for Adaptation and 
Mitigation” (G5A), will be established and convene its first meeting on the sidelines of 
the Paris Conference. 
Finally, Algeria aims to establish and host a World Forum on Renewable Energy that 
will provide the appropriate platform for dialogue and consultation between policy-
makers, industry and civil society. The first session of the Forum will be held in 2016. 
Its outcomes will be presented at the 22nd Conference of the Parties. 
Conclusion 
The ambition of GHG mitigation- shown by Algeria in its provisional INDC- is based 
on four pillars: an institutional tool represented by the National Climate Change 
Agency, a mechanism of coordination and monitoring represented by the National 
Climate Committee, the climate roadmap of Algeria through the National Climate 
10 
 
Plan, and the national MRV system (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) that 
will be established.   
The climate strategy of Algeria is defined in the National Climate Plan. It aims, 
notably, at reinforcing water resources mobilization, controlling flood, protecting the 
coastline, combating drought and desertification and increasing the ecosystems and 
agriculture resilience and facing climate change.   
For that purpose, Algeria is committed to finalize and adopt its National Climate Plan 
before the 21st Conference of the Parties.

Annex 
to the Government Decision N 610 – L, 22 April 2021 
 
NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 2021-2030 OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
ARMENIA 
TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT 
1. The Republic of Armenia ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change in May 1993. In December 2002, Armenia ratified the Kyoto 
Protocol, and in February 2017, it ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto 
Protocol and the Paris Agreement. In May 2019, the Republic of Armenia ratified 
the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, undertaking a commitment to 
phase down HFCs1. Armenia remains committed to multilateral process addressing 
the climate change. 
2. The Republic of Armenia submitted its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in September 2015. The INDC 
started with a preparatory period 2015-2019, following with a next phase from 
2020, with a horizon to 2050.  
3. With the ratification of the Paris Agreement in February 2017, the INDC of Armenia 
became its nationally determined contribution (NDC) for the period of 2015 – 
2050.  
4. The Republic of Armenia is a developing country and, as a developing country 
Party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, it is not included in the 
Annex I to the Convention. Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement provides 
that developed country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking 
economy-wide absolute emission reductions targets, and that developing country 
Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts and are encouraged to 
move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in 
the light of different national circumstances.  
5. In its 2015 INDC, Armenia undertook to pursue economy-wide mitigation 
measures, striving to achieve per capita net emissions of 2.07 tCO2eq in 2050, 
 
1 From year 2033, the ban will be enacted on the import of HFCs to the Republic of Armenia from the 
countries that are not Parties to Kigali Amendment, export to the said countries, as well as the transit 
transfer of HFCs through the territory of the Republic of Armenia to the said countries.

subject to adequate international financial, technological and capacity-building 
support. 
6. By 2030, Armenia is going to double its share of renewables in energy generation 
on the path to achieve climate neutrality in the second half of this century.  
7. Armenia is a land-locked country with vulnerable mountainous ecosystems, 
already facing negative impacts of climate change and water scarcity. Therefore, 
adaptation policies and measures are of paramount importance for Armenia’s 
ability to achieve its social and economic development goals. 
8. This submission constitutes the update of the INDC, which was submitted in 2015, 
following guidance provided by decision 4/CMA.1, decision 9/CMA.1 and decision 
18/CMA.1. It provides up-front information on the emission reductions to be 
achieved by 2030 and on adaptation measures to be undertaken as part of the 
NDC, together with information on “action and support”. 
9. The NDC is based on the principle of green economy and is compatible with the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflected in social and economic 
development goals of the Republic of Armenia. 
10. In its updated NDC, the Republic of Armenia adopts a ten-year NDC 
implementation period (2021-2030) unlike its INDC, which proposed a timeframe 
of 2015-2050. Armenia maintains its 2050 mitigation goal of reducing its GHG 
emissions to at most 2.07 tCO2eq/capita, to be reflected in its Long Term - Low 
Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS). The new mitigation target to be 
achieved in 2030 equals 40 per cent reduction below 1990 emissions levels.

PLANNING PROCESSES  
10. Planning processes and 
implementation plans 
 
Planning processes 
• Coordination of the NDC preparation and 
monitoring of its implementation is a task of the 
Inter-agency Coordinating Council on Climate 
Change, established by the Decision No 955 of 
the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia of 
02 October 2012. The Council is composed of 
representatives of 10 ministries, three State 
agencies adjunct to the Government and two 
independent bodies, namely the Armenian 
Public Services Regulatory Commission and 
Statistical Committee of the Republic of 
Armenia.  
• Public consultation process of the NDC update 
has been carried out in line with the 
government procedures, including involvement 
of the civil society, in a gender-responsive 
6 
manner, and followed by a parliamentary 
debate.  
• The implementation of the NDC will be 
supported on subnational level by involving 
local 
communities 
and 
encouraging 
all 
stakeholders to take action, including NGOs, 
taking into account the needs of youth, 
vulnerable groups, in a gender-responsive 
manner.   
In the planning processes, the following national 
circumstances have been considered:  
• Armenia GHG emissions come primarily from 
the 
energy 
sector 
(electricity 
and 
heat 
generation, 
other 
stationary 
and 
mobile 
combustion 
including 
in 
transport 
and 
residential sectors, fugitive emissions from 
natural gas system). In 2018, total primary 
energy supply (TPES) in Armenia amounted to 
3.15 million toe or 1.1 toe/capita; 
• Armenia has practically no domestic resources 
of fossil fuels and highly depends on fossil fuel 
imports. In 2018, 28.4 per cent of TPES was 
covered by indigenous resources: nuclear 
energy, hydro energy, biofuels, and small share 
of solar and wind energy;  
• Natural gas accounted for 64.9 per cent of 
Armenia’s TPES in 2018 (2.04 million toe), 
followed by oil products: 10.2 per cent (0.3 
million 
toe). 
Energy 
efficiency, 
energy 
conservation 
and 
renewable 
energy 
development are key priorities for the country’s 
energy security and key drivers of low carbon 
development; 
• In 2018, Armenia produced 0.67 million toe 
electricity, of which 43.3 per cent came from 
natural gas fired thermal power plants, 29.8 per 
cent came from hydro power plants, 26.6 per 
7 
cent came from nuclear power plant and 0.3 per 
cent from wind and solar plants. Since 1990, 
Armenia gradually and completely phased out 
fuel oil (mazut) from the electricity mix. The 
government of Armenia does not subsidize the 
use of fossil fuels;  
• Total final consumption of energy in 2018 was 
2.15 million toe. Households are the largest 
consumers of final energy (33.1 per cent). 
Transport is the second largest final energy 
consuming sector (33.0 per cent);  
• Armenia is a small, landlocked country, it is 
responsible for 0.02 per cent of global GHG 
emissions. In 2017, total GHG emissions 
amounted to 10,624 Gg CO2eq and net GHG 
emissions amounted to 10,180 Gg CO2eq (NIR 
2017);  
• Armenia is an upper-middle income country 
with a small population, yet Armenia is 
assuming its responsibility and is ready to do its 
fair share in terms of emission reductions. In 
line with the outcomes of the Talanoa Dialogue 
of 2017-2018, Armenia is prepared to increase 
its ambition and in time go climate neutral with 
the help of international donors; 
• Long-term 
planning 
until 
2050 
will 
be 
undertaken as part of preparation of Armenia’s 
Long-Term 
Low 
Emissions 
Development 
Strategy, with a view to the government 
adopting this document in 2021. Armenia 
anticipates being able to access adequate 
financial, technological, and capacity building 
support to mitigate and adapt to climate 
change; 
• The main considerations taken into account by 
the government when updating the NDC were 
to maintain the growth of national economy, 
poverty reduction, environment protection, 
8 
achievement of sustainable development goals, 
while increasing national energy security and 
ensuring affordable and clean energy supply.   
Implementation plans 
Implementation 
of 
the 
2021-2030 
NDC 
is 
safeguarded by the national and sectoral strategies 
and their implementation programmes, such as: 
• Republic of Armenia 2014-2025 Strategic 
Program of Perspective Development3 outlines 
actions to maximize the use of domestic energy 
resources, focusing on renewable energy and 
promoting energy efficiency;  
• Programme of the Government of Armenia4 
(2019) puts emphasis on the development of 
nuclear energy,  renewable energy sources, 
introduction of energy efficient and new 
technologies for ensuring energy security and 
providing affordable and reliable energy supply 
as well as for mitigating and preventing 
problems 
resulting 
from 
climate 
change, 
pursuant 
to 
the 
commitments 
under 
international agreements, the development and 
implementation of a sustainable policy for 
promoting green economy and achieving long-
term sustainable development goals;   
• Provisions of the EU-Armenia Comprehensive 
and 
Enhanced 
Partnership 
Agreement 
Roadmap5 with 12 actions on climate change 
and 34 energy efficiency, renewable energy, and 
energy security actions;  
• ""Strategic Program for the Development of the 
Energy Sector of the Republic of Armenia (until 
2040)”6, which safeguards national priority of

energy security based upon nuclear energy, 
modern 
gas 
fired 
generation 
plants, 
development and expansion of economically 
viable and technically available renewable 
energy 
sources, 
mostly 
solar 
energy. 
Particularly, after realizing small hydro potential, 
mostly after 2000, the focus is shifted to solar 
energy and wind. Armenia is developing solar 
energy capacity from current 59.57 MW to 1000 
MW before 2030, to increase both, green 
energy share and energy security (at least 15 
per cent in 2030 in power generation mix);  
• A national Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy Programme 2021-2030, which will define 
new sectoral targets8; 
• Transport Strategy: increased efficiency of 
public transport, use of renewable energy, 
stimulation and support in uptake of electric 
vehicles; 
• Agriculture strategy (2020-2030)9: improved 
nitrogen 
fertilizer 
management 
and 
development of organic farming, sustainable 
intensification of animal breeding through 
improved species, breeds, improved irrigation 
system, promotion of digital agriculture and

for in the NDC. 
Financing  
• The financing needs assessment is part of the 
National Implementation Plan for 2021-2030 
NDC, which is under preparation;  
• Armenia seeks to develop a debt-for-climate 
innovative financial swap mechanism, which 
aims at leveraging additional finance into 
climate action and suggests innovating not only 
the technical aspects of the debt-for-climate 
transaction, but the prioritization and value of 
commitments undertaken by countries across 
the world on a bilateral and multilateral level. 
• Ministries and state agencies responsible for the 
implementation of sectoral strategies: Ministry 
of 
Environment, 
Ministry 
of 
Territorial 
Administration and Infrastructure, Ministry of 
Finance, 
Ministry 
of 
Economy, 
Statistical 
Committee, 
Public 
Services 
Regulatory 
Commission, Urban Development Committee, 
Cadaster Committee.  
11. Voluntary cooperation 
under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement 
The NDC commitment will be met through 
domestic actions, although donor support will be 
indispensable 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
its 
implementation.  
In order to promote and contribute to mitigation 
outcomes over and above its domestic efforts, 
Armenia intends to participate in market and non-
market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement, subject to relevant provisions having 
been adopted by Parties to the Agreement, namely 
in cooperative approaches enabling the use of 
internationally transferred mitigation outcomes 
11 
(ITMOs) under Article 6.2 by other Parties towards 
their NDCs, in project mechanisms under Article 
6.4, providing additional mitigation outcomes to 
support the achievement of NDC goals by other 
countries, and in non-market approaches under 
Article 6.8 of the agreement. Armenia is already 
cooperating with the European Union and its 
Member States to promote measures at domestic, 
regional and international level, including with 
regard to market and non-market mechanisms for 
addressing climate change.11 
ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 
12. Adaptation to climate 
change 
 
In the planning processes, the following national 
circumstances have been considered:  
1. Armenia is a land-locked, mountainous country 
with altitudes ranging from 375 to 4090 meters 
above sea level and has six climate zones: dry 
subtropical, semi dessert, steppe, forest, alpine 
and cold high mountainous; 
2. The climate of Armenia is rather dry with 
annual precipitations of 592 mm, some regions 
are 
arid, 
while 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
precipitation are observed in the mountains. 
Within the period of 1935-2016 the total 
precipitation decreased by about 9 per cent 
(with faster decrease after 1996) which 
necessitates 
corresponding 
adaptation 
measures in agriculture and better water 
management; 
3. The average air temperature has significantly 
increased compared to the 1961-1990 annual 
average: by 1.03°C during 1929-2012, and 
during 1929-2016 this increase made 1.23°C. 
Basis and approaches to adaptation 
 
11 The scope of this bilateral cooperation is outlined in Chapter IV of the EU-Armenia Comprehensive 
and Anhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and in its Annex IV 
12 
1. Adaptation strategy and contributions are 
based on the requirement of the UNFCCC 
Article 2 “Objective”, which is to restrain 
climate change within timeframe sufficient to 
allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate 
change. 
Thus, 
the 
natural 
ecosystems 
adaptation approach in NDC is considered 
pivotal for Armenia’s adaptation strategy and 
actions (contribution), and a basis for the 
development of the National Adaptation Plan 
2021-2030.  
2. General objective of the NAP process is to 
promote reduction and management of climate 
risks in Armenia by addressing the impacts of 
climate change, taking advantage of emerging 
opportunities, avoiding losses and damages and 
building mechanisms enabling adaptation of 
natural, human, production and infrastructure 
systems. Adaptation activities will be prioritized 
based on sectors’ vulnerability to climate 
change: 
− Natural ecosystems (aquatic and 
terrestrial, including forest ecosystems, 
biodiversity and land cover) 
− Human health 
− Water resource management 
− Agriculture, including fishery and forests 
− Energy 
− Human settlements and infrastructures 
− Tourism. 
3. The Republic of Armenia embraces the 
ecosystem approach for adapting to climate 
change. The ecosystem-based approach to 
adaptation 
is 
in 
harmony 
with 
the 
environmental policy of the country, linked to 
the Long-Term Strategy to 2050 and to Armenia 
development priorities.  
4. Ecosystem based Adaptation is expected to 
13 
become part of policy mix in each sector, as 
reflected in Sectoral Adaptation Plans (SAPs). 
This ensures that mechanisms and policies 
supporting 
improved 
biodiversity 
and 
ecosystem services, income generation, poverty 
reduction, adoptive development or resilience 
of 
infrastructure 
and 
carbon 
emission 
mitigation co-benefits are integrated into 
sectoral and sub-national activities to reduce 
the country’s overall vulnerability to climate 
change. 
5. The NAP will undergo periodic review and 
revision in 5-year cycles, in conjunction with 
updates to the National Communications, 
submission of adaptation communications and 
other 
relevant 
Measuring 
Reporting 
and 
Verification processes under the Convention 
and the Paris Agreement, providing the 
information necessary to track progress on the 
implementation and achievement of policies 
and measures.  
ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES, INCLUDING THOSE FOR 
ESTIMATING AND ACCOUNTING FOR ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS AND, AS APPROPRIATE, REMOVALS 
13. Assumptions and 
methodological 
approaches used for 
accounting for 
anthropogenic GHG 
emissions and 
removals 
corresponding to the 
Party’s NDC  
 
• Methodologies for estimating emissions are 
based on IPCC 2006 Guidelines for national 
greenhouse gas inventories. 
• The IPCC 2006 Inventory Software, developed 
for these Guidelines, was used for data entry, 
emission 
calculation, 
results 
analysis 
and 
conclusions. 
• Global Warming Potential was used on a 100-
year timescale in accordance with the IPCC’s 
2nd Assessment Report (“1995 IPCC GWP 
Values”) as a basis for conversion of CH4, N2O, 
F-gases emissions to CO2eq.  
• GHG emissions and removals were estimated 
14 
using tier 1, 2 and 3 methodologies from the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines. In the case of key 
categories, tier 2 and 3 methodologies were 
mainly applied. Tier 3 methods were used for 
estimating CO2 emissions from electricity 
generation and cement production. Tier 2 
methods were used for estimating emissions 
from stationary and mobile combustion of 
natural gas, fugitive CH4 emissions from natural 
gas, HFC emissions from refrigeration and air 
conditioning (method 2A), CH4 emissions from 
enteric fermentation and manure management 
of cattle, buffalo and sheep, net CO2 removals 
from forest land remaining forest land, and CH4 
emissions from solid waste disposal. 
• Detailed information on each category is 
provided in the NIR2017, including an overview 
of 
emissions 
share; 
a 
description 
of 
methodology used; sources of data used; 
uncertainty analysis; consistent time-series; 
source-specific 
quality 
assurance/quality 
control; 
source-specific 
recalculations; 
and 
source-specific recommendation and planned 
improvements. 
14. Transparency 
Transparency of mitigation and adaptation actions 
will be ensured through: 
1. The introduction of national MRV system 
reflecting modalities, procedures and guidelines 
for the transparency framework for action and 
support referred to in Article 13 of the Paris 
Agreement (Decision 18/CMA.1); 
2. Biennial development of National Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions Inventory; 
3. Development and submission to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat of National Communications and 
Biennial Update Reports/ Biennial Transparency 
Reports (from 2024); 
15 
4. Maintaining participatory process in the NDC 
review and public consultation mechanism 
during preparation of next NDCs, in a gender-
responsive manner;  
5. Open and accessible information system 
ensured through strengthening cooperation 
between public service providers and civil 
society organizations. 
WHY THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA CONSIDERS THAT ITS NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION IS FAIR AND AMBITIOUS IN THE LIGHT OF ITS 
NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
15. To what extent the 
NDC of the Republic of 
Armenia is fair and 
ambitious considering 
the national 
circumstances 
 
 
• The target of the 2020NDC, compared to the 
2015INDC has been brought in line with the 
latest data on GHG emissions and capabilities of 
the country, taking into account a 10-year 
timeframe aligned with that of the majority of 
Parties to the Paris Agreement, as well as 
aligned with preparations to the global stock 
take.  
• Armenia’ s current emissions are below 0.02 per 
cent of total global emissions. 
• In 1993 relative to 1990 the GDP shrank by 53.1 
per cent due to the collapse of the economic 
system of the Soviet Union. From 1994 onwards, 
GDP growth rebounded. In the period of 1994-
2018, average GDP growth amounted to 6.2 per 
cent, with exception of 2009, when the GDP fell 
by 14.1 per cent. 
• The economic recovery in Armenia was 
accompanied with significant progress towards 
low carbon development. In 2017 compared to 
1990, greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP 
(constant 2010 prices) fell 4.7 times and made 
0.86 Gg CO2eq. /million USD. GDP energy 
intensity also dropped 4.7 times from 1990 to 
2017 and made 0.27 toe/1000 USD. This is due 
to structural changes in the economy, the 
16 
widespread use of renewable energy resources, 
the use of low-carbon technologies, and the 
implementation of EE measures, which are an 
evidence of Armenia's low-carbon development 
trends.12  
• Armenia plans to continue growing as low-
carbon, modern economy, and to contribute to 
the long-term global goal of the Convention and 
of the Paris Agreement in line with its capability 
and respective capacity. 
16. How the NDC of the 
Republic of Armenia 
contributes towards 
achieving the objective 
of the Convention as 
set out in its Article 2 
NDC of the Republic of Armenia has been 
formulated based on the assumption that it will 
contribute to: 
1. Holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial level and pursuing efforts to limit the 
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels, recognizing that this would 
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of 
climate change;  
2. Furthering the objective of the Convention, 
while guided by its principles, including the 
principle 
of 
equity 
and 
common 
but 
differentiated responsibilities and respective 
capabilities, in the light of specific national 
circumstances; 
3. Applying an ecosystem-based approach to 
mitigation 
and 
adaptation 
actions, 
giving 
preference to balanced and combined actions.

AUSTRALIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION – COMMUNICATION 2022
I. Australia’s strengthened climate ambition
This submission communicates Australia’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 
under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.
In this updated NDC, Australia is increasing the ambition of its 2030 target, 
committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.
Australia also reaffirms its target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. 
Both targets are economy-wide emissions reduction commitments, covering 
all sectors and gases included in Australia’s national inventory.
Australia’s new 2030 target is a significant increase in ambition. It is a 15 percentage 
point increase on the upper end of the previous 2030 target of 26 – 28% below 2005 
levels – or half as much again as the previous target. The revised 2030 commitment is 
both a single-year target to reduce emissions 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 and a 
multi‑year emissions budget from 2021-2030.
The updated 2030 target puts Australia on track to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. 
It reflects the Australian Government’s resolve to urgently step up action and work alongside 
global partners to tackle the climate crisis, achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and 
keep 1.5°C within reach. Our aspiration is that the commitments of our industry, states 
and territories and the Australian people will yield even greater emissions reductions 
in the coming decade.
Australia will not carry over any overachievement on its 2020 target or its Kyoto 
Protocol targets to meet its Paris Agreement targets.
The Australian Government is implementing a substantial and rigorous suite of new 
policies across the economy to drive the transition to net zero. Australia’s new 2030 target 
is based on the modelled impact of these policies. The Australian Government is working 
to urgently implement these policies to maximise their emissions reduction impact and 
economic benefits and to provide Australian industry with a comprehensive and consistent 
policy framework. Australia’s new policies include:
	
y
A $20 billion investment in Australia’s electricity grid to unlock greater penetration 
of renewable energy and accelerate decarbonisation of the grid.
	–
Complemented by an additional $300 million to deliver community batteries 
and solar banks across Australia.
	
y
Investment of up to $3 billion from the new National Reconstruction Fund to 
support renewables manufacturing and the deployment of low emissions technologies, 
broadening Australia’s industrial base, bolstering regional economic development, 
and boosting private investment in abatement.
	
y
A Powering the Regions Fund to support the development of new clean energy 
industries and the decarbonisation priorities of existing industry.
	–
The Fund will also prioritise building the workforce skills and capability required 
for the clean energy transition. The Australian Government will invest a further 
$100 million to train 10,000 New Energy Apprentices in the jobs of the future 
and establish a $10 million New Energy Skills Program to provide additional 
training pathways.
	
y
The introduction of declining emissions baselines for Australia’s major emitters, 
under the existing Safeguard Mechanism, providing a predictable policy framework 
for industry, consistent with a national trajectory to net zero and supporting 
international competitiveness.
	
y
Australia’s first National Electric Vehicle Strategy, to reduce emissions and accelerate 
the uptake of electric vehicles, including by establishing a new Driving the Nation Fund 
and doubling the Commonwealth’s investment in charging and refuelling infrastructure 
to $500 million. The Australian Government will also introduce an electric car tax 
discount and establish a real-world emissions testing program to help consumers 
make more informed choices about the fuel efficiency of their vehicles.
	
y
The application of new standardised and internationally-aligned reporting 
requirements for climate risks and opportunities for large businesses.
	
y
A commitment to reduce the emissions of Commonwealth Government agencies 
to net zero by 2030 (excluding defence and security agencies).

AUSTRALIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION – COMMUNICATION 2022
These new measures will build on existing emissions reduction and low emissions 
technology accelerator policies and programs including the Australian Renewable 
Energy Agency, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, crediting under the Carbon 
Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, and a range of investments to accelerate 
and facilitate low emissions and clean energy technologies, such as green hydrogen, 
energy storage, and low emissions steel and aluminium, to bring their costs down 
to make them competitive with higher emitting alternatives.
The Australian Government will introduce a new annual statement to Parliament on 
climate policy, progress against national targets and international developments and 
will seek to formalise its targets in legislation. The annual statement and other climate 
policy will be informed by Australia’s Climate Change Authority, which the Government 
will restore as an independent source of advice.
Australia is committed to working closely with our Pacific family to achieve an ambitious 
international response to the climate crisis, including talking with them about jointly 
hosting a future UNFCCC Conference of the Parties meeting.
As a federation, Australian States, Territories and local government also implement 
significant policies and programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support clean 
energy technologies. Australian households, communities and businesses are increasingly 
playing their part in addressing climate change and embracing the opportunities 
presented by the transition to net zero.
The details of Australia’s new 2030 target, and its 2050 net zero target are provided in 
Table 1. Australia will track progress towards both targets in its Biennial Transparency Reports 
under the Paris Agreement, on the basis of national emissions reported in its annual National 
Inventory Report. Australia will also provide detailed information on each of its policies 
and measures in its Biennial Transparency Reports.

AUSTRALIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION – COMMUNICATION 2022
II. Australia’s action to advance adaptation and resilience
Climate change is already having significant impacts in Australia and our region. 
The Australian Government is taking concerted action to adapt to climate change 
and ensure the resilience and disaster readiness of our communities and natural 
environment in the context of its impacts.
This includes:
	
y
Leading the development of an urgent climate risk assessment of the implications 
of climate change for national security, which will be an enduring feature of 
Australia’s climate action.
	
y
Making sure Australia is disaster ready by spending up to $200 million every year 
on disaster preparation and resilience projects.
	
y
Protecting Australia’s unique environment by fixing Australia’s urban rivers and 
catchments, and doubling the number of Indigenous Rangers, recognising the 
importance of employing Indigenous People’s knowledge and experience to 
address the climate crisis.
	
y
Investing in the health and resilience of our ocean ecosystems, including by 
strengthening the management of our national network of Marine Parks and 
spending an additional $194.5 million on top of existing investments to protect 
the Great Barrier Reef.
	
y
Establishing a Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water, 
so that climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as the climate and biodiversity 
crises, can be addressed holistically.
Australia looks forward to making even stronger contributions to global climate 
science and sharing our expertise, experiences and skills across the globe toward 
stronger adaptation and resilience outcomes.

1.4.3
IPCC methodologies and metrics 
used and existing approaches
Australia intends to apply 100 year Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) as contained in inventory reporting 
guidelines, currently IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 100 year GWPs, or as otherwise agreed by the CMA.
The estimates of emissions and removals used in accounting for the NDC will be those reported in the Inventory, which 
will apply the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, or subsequent version or refinement as agreed by the CMA, and nationally appropriate 
methods consistent with that guidance and informed inter alia by the IPCC 2019 Refinement and IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement.
1.4.4
Natural disturbances
Australia will address emissions and subsequent removals from natural disturbances in accounting for its NDC. The carbon 
stock changes from natural disturbances are included in the national emissions totals, as described in Australia’s National 
Inventory Report (May 2022) consistent with approaches set out in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and the IPCC 2019 Refinement. 
Australia will continue to provide information on its approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from natural

Construction of the 
reference indicators
The emissions budget for the 2030 target 
is calculated using a straight-line trajectory 
which takes a linear decrease from 2020 to 
2030. This trajectory begins from Australia’s 
2020 target (5% below 2000 levels), and 
finishes at 43% below 2005 levels in 2030. 
The area under the trajectory for the period 
2021–2030 is the emissions budget for the 
2030 target.
The reference indicator for the 
2030 single-year target is net 
national greenhouse gas emissions 
for the year 2005, as published 
in the National Inventory Report 
annually. The definitions, data 
sources and models used to 
estimate net emissions are 
those described in the National 
Inventory Report.
The reference indicator for the 
2050 commitment is net national 
greenhouse gas emissions in the 
most recently available year, as 
published in the National Inventory 
Report annually. The definitions, data 
sources and models used to estimate 
net emissions are those described 
in the National Inventory Report.

Table 2: Fair and Ambitious Contribution, Contribution to Article 2, 
Planning Processes Information and Article 4.
2.1
How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:
2.1.1
A fair and ambitious 
contribution
Australia’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution represents a significant increase in Australia’s ambition and reflects 
a strong commitment to urgent ambitious action on climate change.
Australia’s enhanced NDC is underpinned by a robust policy framework that will deliver on our emissions reduction commitments 
while driving economic growth, making electricity more affordable and creating new jobs. Australia is implementing a substantial 
and rigorous suite of new policies that will drive the uptake of existing technology, encourage innovation in existing industries 
and invest in the technology and industries of the future to achieve our 2030 target and support Australia’s transition to net zero.
2.1.2
Fairness considerations, 
including reflecting on equity
Australia’s plan to achieve its 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets has the wellbeing and prosperity of all Australians, 
including regional communities, at its core. It recognises the global transition to a clean energy economy is underway, creating 
impacts and opportunities for Australia’s industries. The Australian Government will support and partner with communities and 
industry on decarbonisation priorities, the development of new clean energy industries and skills and training programs to support 
workforce development. This will ensure that Australia is well-positioned to capitalise on clean economy opportunities to drive 
growth and support job creation.
The Australian Government has committed to reduce the emissions of Commonwealth Government agencies to net zero emissions 
by 2030 (excluding defence and security agencies). Emissions reductions across non-Defence (Australian Public Service) agencies 
is a strong commitment to lead by example on emissions reductions and contribute to the decarbonisation of Australia’s economy.
The Australian Government will also improve integrity in decision-making around climate change with a new annual statement to 
Parliament as a matter of transparency and accountability. This will report on climate policy and progress towards national targets. 
The Government will also restore the role of Australia’s Climate Change Authority as an independent source of advice.
2.1.3
How the NDC is a progression 
and reflects highest possible 
ambition
Australia’s updated NDC is a progression on our previous 2030 target and a significant increase in ambition, committing Australia 
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 — half as much again as the previous target of 26 – 28% 
— and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
2.1.4
Economy-wide absolute 
emissions reduction targets
Australia’s 2030 and 2050 targets are economy-wide absolute emissions reduction targets.
2.1.5
Special circumstances of LDCs 
and SIDS
Not applicable.
2.2
How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2:
2.2.1
How the NDC contributes 
towards achieving the objective 
of the Convention as set out 
in its Article 2
Achievement of Australia’s 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets will contribute towards stabilisation of greenhouse gas 
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. 
Both targets will also be achieved in a manner which will ensure economic growth and will be complemented by measures 
to advance adaptation, ensure security of food production and to enable sustainable economic development.
12
AUSTRALIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION – COMMUNICATION 2022
2.2.2
How the NDC contributes 
towards the Paris Agreement’s 
temperature and mitigation 
goals
Achievement of Australia’s 2030 and 2050 emissions reduction targets will contribute towards holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C 
above pre‑industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.
The Australian Government is implementing a series of new policies across the economy to support the uptake of existing technology, 
encourage innovation in existing industries and invest in the technology and industries of the future. These measures will support the 
achievement of the 2030 target and put Australia on the path to net zero emissions by 2050.
2.3
Planning Processes:
2.3.1
Information on planning 
processes and implementation 
plans for the preparation of the 
NDC including, as appropriate:
Domestic institutional 
arrangements, public 
participation and engagement 
with local communities and 
indigenous peoples, in a gender-
responsive manner
The Commonwealth Government of Australia is responsible for policy making at the national level.
The Australian Government will improve integrity in decision-making around climate change through annual statements to Parliament 
on climate policy, including progress against national targets, and by restoring Australia’s Climate Change Authority. This will provide 
transparency and ensure accountability on climate action.
The Australian Government is implementing a broad suite of new policies across the economy to drive the transition to a net zero economy, 
and is improving and strengthening existing policies.
The Australian Government will build on the 2019 King Review, by undertaking a review into Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) to 
ensure their integrity and consistency with agricultural and other objectives, and contribution to environmental, economic and other benefits 
like biodiversity. The Australian Government will also improve the Safeguard Mechanism by introducing mandatory emissions baselines for 
facilities already covered by the Mechanism over time. This will align policy with recommendations from the private sector and will provide a 
supportive policy framework that will encourage industry investment in low emissions technologies.
Australia provides information on its climate change policies and measures in each Biennial Report and National Communication 
and will continue to provide updated information through each Biennial Transparency Report.
2.3.2
Contextual matters, including, 
inter alia, as appropriate:
National circumstances, such as 
geography, climate, economy, 
sustainable development and 
poverty eradication
Australia’s unique national circumstances shape its response to climate change. Australia’s system of government, vast size, diverse 
landscapes, predisposition to climate variability, resource-based economy and small but growing population living mostly in coastal 
regions pose challenges and opportunities to managing the impacts of climate change.
Australia operates under a federal system of government in which legislative powers are distributed between the Commonwealth, 
the six states and two territories. Under this system, the Commonwealth Government of Australia is responsible for policy making 
at the national level. National targets and federal emissions reductions policies are complemented by targets and measures implemented 
at the State and Territory level, which make a leading contribution to the decarbonisation of Australia’s economy.
Climate change holds serious ramifications for all Australians, playing a part in extreme weather events and their intensity and frequency. 
The Australian Government’s policy measures recognise these impacts and provide the framework to support Australians on the pathway 
to net zero transition. These policies will accelerate decarbonisation of industry and support the development of new clean energy 
industries through investment to drive renewables manufacturing and the deployment of low emissions technologies.
Australia is transforming its electricity market, from an electricity grid dominated by large scale, fossil fuel-fired generators to a grid 
with increasing penetration of renewables, storage and demand management technologies.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

The content of the EU NDC has been based on an extensive impact 
assessment3, as well as stakeholder input, collected via public consultation4. 
 
The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender 
equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: 
the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.

(c) 
How the Party’s preparation of its nationally determined 
contribution has 
been informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement; 
The EU shall set its climate target in accordance with the European Climate 
Law. To that end, at the latest within 6 months of the first Global Stocktake, 
the Commission shall make a legislative proposal, as appropriate, on a Union-
wide climate target for 2040 based on a detailed impact assessment, as per 
article 4.3 of the European Climate Law REGULATION (EU) 2021/1119 OF

Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures 
have been considered in developing the nationally determined 
contribution; 
 
Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented

on adaptation plans that also yield mitigation co-benefits, 
which may cover, but are not limited to, key sectors, such as 
energy, resources, water resources, coastal resources, human 
settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Introduction 
As agreed at the Conference of the Parties in Paris (COP21), all party states, 
regardless of their level of development and political objectives, shall mobilise more 
intensively to take urgent actions for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
According to the 6th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures will continue to rise until at least the 
middle of this century under all scenarios considered for emissions. Moreover, 
global warming will exceed 1.5°C or 2°C in the 21st century unless drastic 
reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) are achieved in the coming decades. 
The Republic of Azerbaijan actively participates in the implementation of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto 
Protocol and the Paris Agreement. 
In accordance with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, the Republic of Azerbaijan 
has introduced its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat in October 2015 and as a contribution to initiatives for preventing global 
climate change (mitigation initiatives) compared to 1990 (base year) aims to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030. 
Since then, the evaluation of the policies pursued by the government and the 
assessment of the measures taken has created an opportunity to propose a higher 
target to the government of Azerbaijan. Taking into account the new realities after 
the liberation of about 20 percent of the country's territories from a 30-year 
occupation and strategic socio-economic development programmes, national 
circumstances, especially the plans for diversification of the economy over the next 
decade, the proposed GHG emission reduction target by 2030 in Azerbaijan's 
Nationally Determined Contribution document is quite ambitious. 
Azerbaijan plans to take part in reducing the environmental impact on the basis 
of its NDC document, primarily through its domestic capacities and has, 
nevertheless, taken important steps in international cooperation in accordance with 
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. 
 
The new version of Azerbaijan's Nationally Determined Contributions by 
2050 includes the following elements: 
 
Azerbaijan's Nationally Determined Contributions by 2050 were renewed in 2023. 
The Republic of Azerbaijan, subject to its sustainable socio-economic development, will 
seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 (base year) level by 
2050 if international support is provided through financing, technology transfer and capacity 
building. 
 
As per the instructions outlined in the decision 4/CMA.

country 
In its 4th National Communication, Azerbaijan 
recorded updated information on sources included in 
the 
greenhouse 
gas inventory. 
Information 
on 
greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere from 
sources that have not been accounted for due to lack 
of data will be included in the reports after 
restructuring 
of 
the 
Monitoring, 
Reporting 
and 
Verification (MRV) system in accordance with the 
requirements of the improved transparency format 
specified in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement. If air 
emissions from these sources are significant, i.e., if 
they are considered a key emission sector, Azerbaijan 
will provide relevant clarifying information on these 
emissions in the next reports to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat. 
Scale and scope: 
General description of the target 
Target covering all sectors 
                                                             
1It should be noted that during the GHG inventory for 1990 (base year), there was some missing data to 
calculate emissions/absorbances for all categories mentioned in the relevant methodological guidelines 
prepared by the IPCC in 2006. In this regard, when inventories are conducted in subsequent years based on 
more complete data for the base year, the GHG emission figure for that year may be subject to change in the 
assessment. Moreover, due to the lack of data for the occupied territories of Azerbaijan for about 30 years, it 
is foreseen to recalculate emissions/absorbances for this period. 
6 
 
The 
Nationally 
Determined 
Contributions includes sectors, 
gases, benchmarks and areas 
including, 
where 
applicable, 
sectors under Guidelines of the 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate Change. 
The target includes: 
1) Energy, industrial processes and product use, 
agriculture, land use, land use change and forestry, 
waste sector 
2) Greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane 
(CH4), nitrogen oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs). 
 
1. Information on the Process of Preparation of the “Nationally Determined 
Contributions” Document 
 
Detailed technical studies were carried out to develop an updated “Nationally 
Determined Contributions” document, including an assessment of energy efficiency 
potential, economic growth, national circumstances and challenges in the economy 
of Azerbaijan. Relevant studies were conducted in cooperation with all 
stakeholders, the academic sector and technical consultants. 
In order to update the “Nationally Determined Contributions” document, taking 
into account the gender considerations, a public consultation process with the 
involvement of civil society was conducted in accordance with government 
procedures. 
Considering the needs of youth and vulnerable groups, local support will be 
provided for the implementation of the updated Nationally Determined 
Contributions by attracting the local population based on gender criteria and 
encouraging all stakeholders and NGOs to take action. 
The Government of Azerbaijan has a political will in achieving the goals set out 
in the Nationally Determined Contributions, including regular consultations with all 
stakeholders, scientists and other participants and poesesses appropriate 
transparency mechanisms in the realisation of the target. In addition, Azerbaijan 
has a State Commission on Climate Change to ensure the implementation and 
monitoring of nationally determined contributions. For the purpose of achieving the 
goals set out in this document, the Commission acts as an intermediary in ensuring 
transparency of climate policy implementation. 
Draft “State Programme on Low Emission Development”, which will be 
developed in addition to the updated Nationally Determined Contributions, will 
indetify new sectoral emissions reduction strategies. The relevant long-term 
planning until 2050 will be carried out within the framework of this programme. 
 
2. National Circumstances  
By ratifying the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto 
Protocol to the Convention and the Paris Agreement, the Republic of Azerbaijan 
has joined the international efforts to mitigate the negative impact of global climate 
change. 
Currently, the obligations of the Republic of Azerbaijan arising from the Paris 
Agreement and their implementation is one of the priorities of the Government of 
7 
 
Azerbaijan. In general, the main objective of the response measures taken by 
states under the Paris Agreement is to maintain global temperature growth at an 
average rate of less than 2°C by the end of the century. 
According to the relevant data, the downward trend in the net emission level 
compared to the 1990 has decreased since 2000 and by 2016 (last year of inventory) 
changed from 46.54% to 31.59% (Table 1). 
 
Table 1. Changes in the level of greenhouse gases compared 
to the net emissions in 1990 (in %) 
 
In 1997, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan signed a decree on the 
establishment of the State Commission on Climate Change to fulfil country’s 
obligations under the UNFCCC. The new composition of the State Commission 
was approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 
11 March 2020. The Chairman of the State Commission is the Deputy Prime 
Minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Deputy Chairman of the Commission 
is the Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
Taking into account the active role of the relevant state bodies in this 
process, the importance of strengthening interdepartmental relations and the 
significance of the State Commission in ensuring the fulfilment of the 
commitments undertaken by the Republic of Azerbaijan within the framework of 
the UNFCCC, a working group of specialists from relevant state bodies was 
established. The action plan of the working group was approved in 2020. The 
Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources is carrying out important intersectoral 
activities to coordinate events. 
In order to revitalise the territories liberated from occupation, the country's 
leadership has taken a number of important decisions regarding the 
implementation of approaches of the “green energy” zone, “green” agriculture, 
“green” transport, “smart” city, “smart” village and reforestation of thousands of 
hectares of land. Large-scale works are being carried out in the above mentioned 
areas in this respect. With the expert support of international consultants, it is 
planned to prepare a concept of a “Net Zero Emissions” zone in the liberated 
territories by 2050. 
Moreover, a technical assistance project “Capacity building for Azerbaijan to 
meet the requirements of enhanced transparency framework of the Paris 
Agreement (CBIT)” is being implemented in order to establish a national GHG 
management system and tracking system of the implementation of Nationally 
Determined Contributions.

Meanwhile, the Republic of Azerbaijan joined Transforming our World: the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and commenced the process of 
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. 
 
      Economic profile 
In recent years, economic mechanisms have been widely used to reduce the 
impact of climate change and different steps have been taken to encourage 
innovative investments, to create special economic zones, industrial parks, etc. in 
Azerbaijan for the promotion of the import of green technologies. Resident 
companies of these industrial parks and zones have been granted a number of 
privileges by the state. In accordance with the Tax Code of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan and the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan ""On Customs Tariff”, residents 
of industrial parks are exempted from property tax, land tax, income or profit tax, 
VAT and customs duties when importing machines, technological equipment and 
devices imported for production purposes for a period of 10 years from the date of 
their registration. 
The Republic of Azerbaijan has favourable natural and climatic conditions 
and is rich in natural resources. Oil and gas production, chemistry and 
petrochemistry, metallurgy, machine building, textile industry, food production, 
agriculture, plant growing, cotton growing, viticulture, fruit growing, tobacco growing, 
tea growing, etc. play an important role in the country's economy.  
A lot of measures have been taken to develop the economy, improve the 
investment 
and 
business 
environment, 
create 
favourable 
conditions 
for 
entrepreneurs, increase state support, expand non-oil exports and import 
substitutions. At the same time, Azerbaijan improved its position in the ranking by 8 
notches, from 65th to 57th, among 190 countries in the “Doing Business 2018” 
report issued by the World Bank. According to this report, Azerbaijan was among 
the top three most reforming countries in Europe and Central Asia. In the World 
Bank's “Doing Business 2020” report, Azerbaijan advanced to the 34th notch.  
Compared to 2020, GDP in 2021 increased by 5.6% in real terms and 
amounted to 93.20 billion manats at current prices. Real GDP per capita increased 
by 5.1% and comprised AZN 9,303.80 or USD 5,472.80 (USD 4,280.8 for the same 
period of the previous year). In 2022, the country produced gross domestic product 
of 133.8 billion manats, which is 4.6% more than in the previous year. GDP per 
capita amounted to 13,292.20 manats.  
Taking into account the greenhouse gas inventory data and GDP dynamics 
in 1990-2016, it is possible to note the considerable growth in greenhouse gas 
emissions in relation to GDP in 1990-2014, as well as a steady growth in recent 
years. Azerbaijan's updated “Nationally Determined Contributions” document 
envisages a number of criteria affecting the country's GHG emissions: e.g., rapid 
GDP growth rate since 2004, demographic growth, investments, energy sector 
prices, technological progress, energy consumption, behaviour and habits and so 
on.

Moreover, with regard to the new goal of doubling GDP in Azerbaijan by 2030 
based on the new 10-year development plan, which requires an average annual GDP 
growth of 7%, the country should implement a number of preventive measures and 
policies aimed at significantly reducing the intensity of energy and greenhouse gas 
emissions in all sectors of the economy in the medium and long term perspectives. It 
should also be borne in mind that following the large-scale restoration and 
reconstruction works carried out in the territories liberated from occupation after the 
44-day war in 2020 and the opening of borders and transport links, the expected 
socio-economic integration in the region will be a significant contribution to the growth 
of GDP and employment in the country. 
The Second Karabakh War was a turning point that changed all environmental 
perspectives, both in terms of combating climate change and its consequences, as 
Azerbaijan liberated its territories from a 30-year occupation and prevented the 
destruction of forests, other ecosystems and biological diversity. The end of the 
conflict has opened up new economic opportunities not only for Azerbaijan, but also 
for the region. In this regard, the restoration, reconstruction and integration of the 
conflict-affected and liberated territories will form the main priorities for Azerbaijan's 
development in the coming years. In addition, the reintegration of the territories into 
the country's economy will create new opportunities with the establishment of new 
green zones, which is an important indicator of the overall decarbonisation of the 
regional economy. 
 
Population and Vulnerable Groups 
 
Azerbaijan's updated Nationally Determined Contributions envisages the current 
population dynamics of the country and claims that the population will reach about 
10.8 million by 2030. 
 
Table 3. Population in 2014-2030, by the beginning of the year 
 
 
Currently, 54.6% of the country's population lives in urban and 45.4% in rural 
areas. As of 1 January 2023, 49.8% of the population is male and 50.2% is female. 
Due to global warming, the number and duration of extreme heat days and peak 
temperatures in the summer months have increased significantly in Azerbaijan. 
Compared to 1960-1990 years, in Baku, which is characterized by a semi-desert and 
dry steppe climate, the number of days with a maximum air temperature of 35oC and 
above in the months of June-August 1991-2020 increased from 86 days to 365 days. 
City dwellers are more sensitive to intense heat. At the peak of prolonged 
extreme summer heat, people find it difficult to adapt.  
In recent decades, precisely because of climate change, the impact of severe 
weather conditions on the population of Azerbaijan reveals the following vulnerable

3. Information on the implemented Climate Policy  
In 2016, greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere amounted to 61.257 
million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the Republic of Azerbaijan and taking into account 
the absorption of these gases, the net emission figure was 54.033 million tonnes of 
CO2 equivalent. This represented 0.15% of the estimated global emissions in 2016. 
According to the greenhouse gas inventory for 1990-2016, Azerbaijan achieved a 
31.6% reduction in emissions in 2016 compared to the baseline year of 1990. 
Azerbaijan's annual population growth rate, projected in official national 
statistics, will increase the demand for energy and other natural resources. This is 
one of the main challenges in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
In 2016, Azerbaijan's per capita emissions amounted to 6.3 tonnes of CO2 
equivalent and considering the absorption, their net figure was 5.6 tonnes of CO2 
equivalent. For comparison, in 2016, the average emissions per capita worldwide 
was 6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

The government systematically takes measures to prevent greenhouse gas 
emissions. Climate change policy is reflected in a number of important development 
priorities and strategies of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
In order to avoid the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce its 
amount, the country will introduce green and smart technologies in accordance with 
the document “Azerbaijan 2030: National Priorities for Socio-Economic Development” 
approved by the President of Azerbaijan on 2 February 2021. Restoration and 
reconstruction works in the liberated territories, as well as reintegration of this region 
into the economy of Azerbaijan have been initiated. Introduction of green, smart 
technologies for comprehensive, flexible and optimal reintegration of this region are 
the main challenges facing the country. Azerbaijan is currently advancing towards the 
creation of smart cities and villages across the country. For example, based on the 
11 
 
decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 27 February 2020 
“National Action Plan for the Promotion of Open Government for 2020-2022”, studies 
have been launched to apply the Smart City concept and identify opportunities for the 
implementation of pilot projects. 
 The document “Azerbaijan 2030: National Priorities for Socio-Economic 
Development” details five national priorities that are particularly relevant to the 
fulfillment of obligations arising from the United Nations' “Agenda for Sustainable 
Development 2030”: 
 
1. a steadily growing, competitive economy; 
2. a dynamic, inclusive society based on social justice; 
3. areas of  modern innovations and competitive human capital; 
4. the great return to the territories liberated from occupation; 
5. a clean environment and country of “green growth”. 
 
The document describes that along with the promising economic development 
of the country, it is necessary to ensure a healthy environment. 
In accordance with this document, the “Strategy of Socio-Economic 
Development of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2022-2026” was approved, where a 
special place was given to measures on combating global climate change. The 
Action plan of the strategy includes, in particular, the development of the greenhouse 
gas inventory and Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system, the 
creation of an institutional framework based on the current MRV system, as well as 
the development of a national database considering the global climate change 
practice. 
At the same time, by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
of 16 November 2022 “the First State Program on the Great Return to the territories 
of the Republic of Azerbaijan liberated from occupation”, as well as by the Decree of 
the Cabinet of Ministers of 21 June 2022 “the Action Plan on the establishment of a 
green energy zone in the liberated territories of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2022-
2026” were approved. 
Chapter 11, entitled “Environmental Protection and Environmental Problems”, of 
the Development Concept “Azerbaijan 2020: Vision for the Future” deals with the 
issues of expanding forest and green areas, applying national standards in 
accordance with European standards on harmful substances emitted into the 
atmosphere and bringing the amount of produced energy and carbon dioxide closer 
to the relevant indicator for the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development.  
Moreover, climate change policies have been incorporated into many sectoral 
legislative acts, including the Laws of the Republic of Azerbaijan “On the Efficient 
Use of Energy Resources and Energy Efficiency”, “On Electric Power Industry”, “On 
Electric Power Industry and Thermal Power Plants”, “Alternative and Renewable 
Energy in the Republic of Azerbaijan”, “State Programme on Resource Utilisation”, 
“State Programme for Socio-Economic Development of Regions of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan for 2019-2023”, “State Programme for Industrial Development of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan for 2015-2020” and other documents. 
Meanwhile, the climate change policy is reflected in the sectoral strategic 
roadmaps prepared for the national economy and its main sectors and approved by 
the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on 6 December 2016. The strategic 
roadmap for the production and processing of agricultural outputs in the Republic of 
12 
 
Azerbaijan details a number of preventive and adaptation policies related to climate 
change. 
In order to fully meet the needs of present and future generations, the document 
particularly emphasises the widespread use of environmentally friendly green 
technologies. Based on scientific and technological potentials, it is necessary to 
increase the share of alternative and renewable energy sources in primary 
consumption in all sectors of the economy and to reduce the impact on climate 
change. The major measures described in the document should encourage the 
decarbonisation of the economy and promote sustainable and inclusive development. 
The State Strategy for the use of alternative and renewable energy sources in 
the Republic of Azerbaijan, developed as an important component of the climate 
policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan, determines the directions of electricity and heat 
production through the wide use of alternative and renewable energy sources, 
energy efficiency, providing consumers with sustainable green energy. In 2020, 
based on the strategic documents, a number of relevant normative acts were 
adopted to ensure that at least 30% (1,500 megawatts) of the total energy capacity of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan is provided by renewable energy sources by 2030. 
In addition, the “National Strategy for Improving Solid Waste Management in the 
Republic of Azerbaijan for 2018-2022” was adopted on 1 November 2018 and 
currently, several other documents are being developed. 
Among the effective preventive measures implemented in the energy sector, the 
reduction of gas emissions from oil and gas production by SOCAR in accordance 
with SOCAR's relevant plan to reduce associated gas emissions should be noted. 
The main objective of these measures is to reduce associated gas emissions during 
normal production process to 95 million m3 per year by 2022, but their duration will be 
extended until 2030 to further strengthen the potential for reducing environmental 
impact. Another effective mitigation measure is the modernization of the gas 
distribution system implemented by “Azerigaz” Production Union. As a result of 
preventive measures, methane gas emissions decreased by 6,693.52 thousand 
tonnes of CO2 equivalent over 2015-2018. 
However, it should be mentioned that the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil 
prices on global energy markets negatively affected the implementation of the Paris 
Agreement in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has adopted a sound strategy to combat 
COVID-19 and minimize the impact of the pandemic on the economy and population. 
National institutions have taken effective measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 
based on a population-based approach. 
Moreover, the Republic of Azerbaijan has joined a number of initiatives aimed at 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and covering various areas, mainly put forward 
by a group of developed countries at the recent conferences of the Parties to the UN 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
 
 
 
4. 
Mitigation Measures of Environmental Impacts 
 
4.1. Targets for reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions 
 
 
Subject to sustainable and balanced socio-economic development, supported by 
international financial assistance and technology transfer, the Republic of 
Azerbaijan updates its Nationally Determined Contributions document in 
13 
 
accordance with the Paris Agreement with the aim of reducing its greenhouse 
gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2050, taking into account 
the maximum possible absorption capacity of forests and ecosystems. 
Azerbaijan has set 31 December 2050 as the deadline for the implementation of 
the country's Nationally Determined Contributions document. The total greenhouse 
gas emissions in the base year of 1990 might be subject to periodic recalculation 
according to methodological improvements on the basis of biennial transparency 
report. Meanwhile, the country will continue planning and implementing appropriate 
adaptation measures by mobilizing local and international funds for sectors 
particularly vulnerable to climate change, as well as exploring its preventive 
measures and adaptation opportunities for various economic sectors. 
 
4.2. 
Sectoral Policies 
 
ENERGY SECTOR 
It is necessary to take into consideration the strategic importance of this sector 
for the economy of Azerbaijan and GDP production. The inventory results showed 
that in 2016 the total reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in this sector (compared 
to 1990) was 35%. On the other hand, the share of greenhouse gas emissions in the 
energy sector amounted to 78.6% of the total share in 2016. 
The Republic of Azerbaijan plans to implement incentive measures to 
accelerate the use of renewable energy sources through flexible regulation of 
alternative energy tariffs, strengthen scientific and technical skills, continue training of 
specialists, raise awareness of energy consumers and involve the private sector in 
this process. For ensuring the implementation of the Decree of the President of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan “On Acceleration of Reforms in the Energy Sector of the 
Republic of Azerbaijan” of 29 May 2019, a number of projects are being undertaken 
to form new production potential in the field of renewable energy and attract private, 
as well as foreign investments. 
In 2022, the groundbreaking ceremonies of the 240 MW wind farm with “ACWA 
Power” Company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and 230 MW solar power plant with 
“Masdar” company of the United Arab Emirates were held. In 2023, “ACWA Power” 
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia signed an Implementation Agreement for the 
implementation of an offshore wind power project with a capacity of up to 1.5 GW, as 
well as an Implementation Agreement for the establishment of a 1 GW onshore solar 
power plant and a “Memorandum of Understanding” on the development of energy 
storage systems in the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
Furthermore, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with BP on the 
assessment of capacity and conditions required for large-scale decarbonised and 
integrated power and transport systems, including renewable energy projects in the 
regions and cities of Azerbaijan"" along with an Implementation Agreement on the 
joint implementation of the 240 MW solar power plant project. 
At the same time, a Framework Agreement was signed with “Fortescue Future 
Industries” company on joint cooperation for the study and development of renewable 
14 
 
energy projects and the potential of “green hydrogen” in Azerbaijan. The contract 
envisages the study and implementation of renewable energy projects for the 
production of renewable energy and “green hydrogen”, “green ammonia” in 
Azerbaijan with a total capacity of up to 12 GW. 
The Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan has prepared a “Roadmap 
for the development of offshore wind energy in Azerbaijan” in cooperation with the 
International Finance Corporation. In 2021, a “Memorandum of Understanding on 
cooperation in the effective use of offshore wind energy” was signed between the 
Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the International Finance 
Corporation. 
With the support of the International Energy Charter, the Ministry of Energy of 
the Republic of Azerbaijan has developed a draft law “on Efficient Use of Energy 
Resources and Energy Effectiveness”, which defines the foundations of state policy 
in the field of energy efficiency and rational consumption of energy resources, which 
entered into force on 1 July 2022. Also on 12 July 2021, the Law “on use of 
renewable energy sources in the generation of electricity” entered into force.  
Moreover, on 22 December 2022, the “Memorandum of Understanding on 
cooperation in the development of the electric power sector of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan” was signed between the Ministry of Energy and the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development”. 
The projected emission reductions in the energy sector can be achieved to a 
large extent through the use of renewable energy sources. However, it should be 
borne in mind that increasing water scarcity due to climate change may lead to a 
decrease in the electricity generated at hydropower plants. The total installed 
capacity of Azerbaijan is about 8 GW, the share of renewable energy sources, 
including large hydropower plants, is 1,310 MW, which comprises approximately 
16.5% of the installed capacity.  
Taking into account the high potential of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
resulting from the expansion of the use of renewable energy sources in the country's 
energy sector, bringing the installed power of renewable sources to at least 30% of 
the total capacity is one of the main goals of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The relevant 
analysis shows that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to gradually launch 
newly built capacities by 2030 with a total volume of about 1,500 MW. The table 
below demonstrates the dynamics of the share of renewable energy sources in the 
installed electric power capacity over the past years.

It should be noted that the increase of the share of renewable energy sources 
in the installed capacity of electricity generation by 24% by 2026 (in line with the 
target of 30% by 2030) was also included in the “Socio-economic Development 
Strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2022-2026”(adopted on 22 July 2022). 
15 
 
The measures taken to reduce losses in the energy sector, particularly in 
production and energy supply, account for about 30% of the total reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Promising preventive measures in this sector can be summarized as follows: 
 Prevention of losses in the energy sector; 
 Ensuring energy efficiency; 
 Reduction of gas emissions into the atmosphere during oil and gas 
production, gas transportation and distribution by using modern technologies; 
 Reduction of losses during transportation and distribution of electric and 
thermal energy; 
 Fuel production pursuant to relevant standards; 
 Expansion of the use of monitoring and measuring devices in electric and 
thermal energy generation and natural gas systems; 
 Accelerating the transition to clean energy sources; 
 Expansion of the use of alternative and renewable energy sources; 
 Expanding the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport, improving 
the intelligent transport management system, increasing the use of public 
transport; 
 Efficient utilisation of waste and application of circular economy model; 
 Formation of green economy and lifestyle, provision of public awareness and 
promotion activities on energy efficiency. 
Additionally, the assessment of the medium-term and long-term impact of 
preventive measures, including the introduction of environmentally friendly 
technologies in the oil and gas industry, a steady transition to green energy sources, 
modernization of gas pipelines, gas transportation and distribution networks, and 
other preventive measures can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. 
Heat Supply 
The strategic roadmap for the development of public utilities (electricity, heat, 
water and gas) in the Republic of Azerbaijan defines specific indicators for the 
installation of modern boiler and heating network systems that fully meets energy 
saving and environmental requirements in the constructed and modernized boiler 
facilities.  
Also, in order to improve the efficiency of work carried out in the country's public 
utilities sector through the use of appropriate mechanisms, enabling effective 
preventive measures to be taken and regulating relations between manufacturers, 
suppliers and consumers, the “rules for the technical operation of electrical and 
thermal installations”, the “procedure for financing, generation, protection, use, 
arranging volume and accounting of fuel resourses”, “the procedure for safety 
equipment in the operation of electrical and thermal installations” and “the procedure 
for carrying out preparatory work for the autumn-winter seasons in the electric and 
thermal energy and gas supply industries” have been approved. 
16 
 
Transport 
Over the past decade, Azerbaijan has undertaken a number of measures to 
develop and improve its transportation system. In order to turn Azerbaijan into an 
attractive transit and trade centre, special attention has been paid to the restoration 
and construction of road and railway infrastructure along the country's north-south 
and east-west transport corridors. A new International Sea Trade Port complex has 
been built in Alat settlement outside the city to improve the ecological condition of the 
port zone located in the central part of Baku and partially eliminate traffic congestion. 
The Baku port was awarded the “EcoPorts” certificate of the European Sea Ports 
Organization.  
Compressed natural gas buses and taxis with electric motors have been put 
into operation in Baku. Construction of special traffic lanes for shuttle buses and 
bicycle paths has started in Baku and other major cities. Overall, it should be noted 
that according to the government relevant decision, passenger buses running in the 
administrative area of Baku city shall be equipped with a compressed natural gas or 
electric motor and this requirement will come into force from 1 January 2025.  
In order to increase the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport, 
promoting measures with tax incentives have been launched since 2019. Import and 
sale of electric vehicles, as well as their chargers are exempt from VAT. Import and 
sale of hybrid cars with a production period of no more than 3 years and engine 
volume not exceeding 2,500 cubic centimetres – are exempted from VAT for 3 years 
from 1 January 2022.  
The import duty rate is 0% only for electric passenger cars with a factory 
production period of up to 3 years, as well as the import duty rate (tariff) for second 
and third level electric chargers for electric cars is set at 0%. For the renewal of the 
transport fleet, an increased excise coefficient is applied to the import of passenger 
cars with gasoline and diesel engines with the production period of more than 7 
years. Since 2023, the import of passenger cars older than 10 years has been 
restricted. 
An online information resource has been created which provides information 
about electric vehicle charging points (EV charging stations) on an interactive map. 
The “Socio-economic development strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 
2022-2026” approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
dated 22 July 2022, set out measures for the “Preparation of the National Plan on 
Electromobility” and “Promotion of circulation of environmentally friendly and safe 
vehicles (cars, buses, etc.) and creation of necessary infrastructure”.  
One of the strategic documents related to the above-mentioned field is the 
“State Program on Road Safety in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2019-2023” 
approved by the Presidential Decree of 27 December 2018. The main purpose of this 
document is to take measures aimed at reducing the negative impact of the transport 
sector on the environment. The action plan for the implementation of the state 
program provides the necessary preventive measures for the creation of a relevant 
basis for fuel quality and the phased implementation of the process of introducing 
Euro-4 and higher standards.  
17 
 
In addition to the above, there are planned expanding the use of 
environmentally friendly transport, electrification of railway lines and transition to an 
alternating current (AC) traction system, improvement of intelligent transport 
management systems and expansion of its application, development of metro mode 
of transport and increasing the number of stations, prioritisation of public transport, 
improvement of highways and street-road network, creating conditions for the use of 
personal transport (bicycles and scooters) and pedestrian zones for walking in 
residential areas and introducing a sustainable transport system as a whole. 
 
INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND PRODUCT USE (IPPU) 
Sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan are related to mining, chemical industry, metallurgy and other product 
manufacturing industries. 
In 2016, greenhouse gas emissions in the IPPU increased by 2.5 times 
compared to 1990 and amounted to 5.12%. This is due to the aforementioned pace 
of industrial development in the country, the increase of the production of clinker as 
an intermediate raw material for cement production since 2011 and the production of 
methanol starting from 2013.  
To reduce emissions from this sector, specific measures should be taken to 
stimulate and promote the use of modern technologies in the public and private 
sectors, encourage energy efficiency and greater use of alternative energy sources 
and develop recycling. 
 
AGRICULTURE, LAND USE, LAND USE CHANGE and FORESTRY 
Agriculture, land use, land use change 
The agricultural sector ranks second in the total volume of greenhouse gas 
emissions in the country after the energy sector. As a result of the measures taken, 
greenhouse gas emissions in this sector accounted for 14.32% of the total in 2014, 
14.1% in 2015 and 14.17% in 2016. The current trend in the development of this 
sector of the economy, natural population growth, as well as the phased 
development of agriculture in the occupied territories may cause an increase in 
greenhouse gas emissions in this area under the baseline scenario.  
In this sense, the Strategic Roadmap for the production and processing of 
agricultural products in the Republic of Azerbaijan covers a number of preventive and 
adaptation policies related to climate change. The document mentions the following 
activities in four priority areas to achieve the 7th strategic goal: 
 Initially, to develop mechanisms to reduce the negative impacts of climate 
change and other natural criteria on agriculture and develop an adequate 
adaptation plan; 
 To develop performance indicators to meet modern requirements for the 
implementation of agricultural production on the basis of environmental 
standards, conduct appropriate assessment, reduce carbon emissions into 
the air in the agricultural sector, create protective forest belts and take other 
18 
 
relevant measures under the priority of improving environmental protection 
mechanisms in the agricultural sector; 
 Creating a mechanism for assessing the environmental impact of the process 
of changing the purpose of land use, improving the management of pastures, 
improving the recovery of irrigated lands, preventing re-salination and 
eliminating other problems within the priority of improving the mechanisms for 
sustainable use of agricultural land and water resources; 
 The last priority of this strategic goal is to serve the development of the 
production of environmentally friendly agricultural products in the country. 
It should be noted that in this sector, the improvement of livestock management, 
the introduction of climate-smart agricultural technologies, the management of animal 
husbandry and poultry farms and agricultural product waste, as well as the expansion 
of the use of renewable energy sources and the increase of energy efficiency are of 
great importance. Meanwhile, as this sector is one of the most vulnerable to climate 
change it requires serious adaptation measures. 
Forestry 
Given the special role of this area in reducing greenhouse gases due to their 
absorption, its development is of particular importance. Forests in the Republic of 
Azerbaijan are not for industrial purposes in general, while sanitary felling is carried 
out in the forests. Forests play an important role in protecting the soil, regulating the 
water regime, in the conservation of biological diversity, shaping the microclimate and 
absorbing carbon from the air. Azerbaijan will continue to store carbon in managed 
forests and soils and collect as much of it as possible from the following sources: 
aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, wood waste, deadwood residues and 
soil organic carbon. 
As part of the strategic goal of “Improving the environmental situation and 
sustainable environmental management”, mentioned in the State Program for 
Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development in the Republic of Azerbaijan, 
which is considered one of the important documents adopted for development, 
specifically describes the issues of extending the territory of forests and increasing 
the share of protected areas in relation to the total area. As a result of the measures 
taken, the level of absorption of greenhouse gases in 2016 doubled from the level of 
1990 to 7.2 million tons of CO2 equivalent. This trend continues growing. 
In the next decade, this area will focus on the implementation of the goal of 
high-quality ecological environment of the 5th national priority called the clean 
environment and country of “green growth”, mentioned in the aforesaid strategic 
document “Azerbaijan 2030: National Priorities for Socio-Economic Development”. 
The implementation of this goal in accordance with the “Socio-economic 
development strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2022-2026” is planned to be 
achieved through the expansion of reforestation and afforestation throughout the 
country, rapid restoration and increase of greenery, efficient use of resources, 
restoration of useless land areas and bringing them into circulation. 
Moreover, as for the implementation of the goal of the 4th national priority, 
called the Great Return to the territories liberated from occupation, described as 
reintegration into economic activity, the country will again return the historical position 
of the Karabakh region to the economic and social network of Azerbaijan. Taking into 
19 
 
account the rich natural resources of this region, its socio-economic restoration will 
be based on modern smart, green technologies, reforestation, expansion of green 
zones and will be implemented within the framework of public-private partnership. 
As part of the implementation of the above-mentioned national priorities, all 
these measures will expand the share of forest areas and protected natural areas in 
the total area and will cause an increase in the absorption potential of greenhouse 
gases in the medium and long term to achieve the goals of the updated Nationally 
Determined Contributions. 
 
WASTE SECTOR 
The factor distinguishing the waste sector from other sectors is explained by the 
increase in the level of greenhouse gases in this sector over a long period since 
1990. Relevant inventory data show that greenhouse gas emissions in this sector 
increased by 72% in 2016 compared to 1990. In addition, in 2016, emissions of 
greenhouse gases in this sector accounted for approximately 2.2% of total emissions. 
The measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in this area are directly 
related to the effective management of the waste sector. The National Strategy for 
Improving Solid Waste Management in the Republic of Azerbaijan defines relevant 
measures for taking concrete steps and achieving positive results. The 
implementation of the National Strategy will create favorable conditions for potential 
entrepreneurs and investors interested in the field of recycling along with the effective 
collection of solid waste, will gradually reduce subsidies from the state budget in this 
area, will accelerate measures to increase the level of waste collection based on paid 
services, will create new enterprises, strengthen the recycling market and increase 
the employment of the population by using international experience and modern 
technologies.

Nationally Determined Contribution of Kingdom of 
Bahrain under UNFCCC 
 
Manama, ………. 2021 
Introduction 
 
The Kingdom of Bahrain hereby communicates in good faith its Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and confirms its commitment to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement (PA). 
 
The development of this NDC is guided by numerous relevant principles and decisions 
as outlined by Article 3 of UNFCCC; decision 24/CP.18, decision 1/CP.19; decision 
1/CP.20; Article 24, decision 1/CP.21; Articles 4.1, 4.7 and 4.15 of the Paris Agreement as 
well as Katowice Rulebook of COP24. 
 
As a developing country, the Kingdom of Bahrain is actively pursuing economic 
diversification considering sustainability as the pillar of its growth. Despite its low 
annual GHG footprint, estimated approximately below 0.1% of the global GHG footprint, 
the Kingdom of Bahrain strives to avoid and reduce emissions in its economic 
development. As per Article 4.7 of the Paris Agreement, at the core of this NDC is 
mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification 
plans. 
 
 
National Circumstances 
 
Being a small developing island state, Bahrain’s coastline and land area have evolved 
considerably over the last 30 years due to a series of land reclamation projects, which 
continue to the present day. Roughly, 111 km2 of reclaimed land has been added since 
1980, accounting for about 15% of its current total land area. Bahrain is an arid country 
 
 
3 
with mild, pleasant winters, and summers that are very hot and humid. Rainfall is 
negligible from April through the end of October, coinciding with high temperatures. 
Relative humidity is highest during the winter months of December through February, 
although other months of the year show only slightly lower levels. 
Bahrain enjoys a rich social milieu, with diverse communities living side by side in 
primarily high-density urban contexts throughout the island. Several key aspects of 
Bahrain’s social fabric are described in the subsections that follow. In 2021, total 
population is slightly over 1.5 million with roughly half of the population comprised of 
expatriates who come to pursue work opportunities. Most of the population is centered 
in the capital, Al Manamah and other major urban centers like Al Muharraq, Al Riffa’ 
and Hamad Town. 
 
Economic diversification with mitigation-co benefits 
 
Launched in 2017, the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) lays out a 
comprehensive set of initiatives to improve national energy efficiency in Bahrain. The 
Plan identifies 22 initiatives across all sectors to achieve a national target of 6% which was 
adopted by Cabinet. The target is set as a reduction of energy consumption in the year 
2025, expressed as a percentage of the average final energy consumption. 
Launched in the same year, the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) 
identified feasible solar, wind and biogas renewable energy options for Bahrain, 
establishing national renewable energy targets, also adopted by Cabinet, of 5% of peak 
capacity by 2025 and 10% by 2035. 
 
Adaptation 
 
Climate change impacts have already been observed in Bahrain and are further 
elaborated on in the Third National Communication Report. The Kingdom of Bahrain has 
undertaken climate change vulnerability and impact assessments that have addressed 
four key areas: Water, agriculture, biodiversity and urban development. 
Bahrain has no choice but to implement urgent measures to build resilience, improve 
disaster risk preparedness and response, and adapt to the increasingly adverse impacts 
of climate change in future. Indeed, there are substantially higher costs associated with 
 
 
4 
adaptation to future impacts of climate change in Bahrain, if actions are initially delayed 
or ignored. At present, the action being taken to address the issue of adaptation is 
executed with limited capacities and resources, with a need for a more comprehensive 
and articulated adaptation package with support from the international community, 
Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the UNFCCC. The Kingdom of Bahrain is undertaking 
the following actions to adapt to climate change: 
Adaptation 
Strategy  
A national adaptation Investment Plan (NAIP) on climate change in 
cooperation with the relevant government agencies is in preparation. 
The plan aims to include adaptation priorities and implementation 
actions. 
Bahrain’s national adaptation planning efforts aims at enhancing the 
adaptive capacity to cope with climate change risks. As part of this 
overarching picture, comes The National Adaptation Investment Plan 
to take the adaptation investment related efforts forward, by 
addressing some of the pressing climate change adaptation needs. 
The National Adaptation Investment Plan is the guiding document to 
identify interventions in order to increase the Kingdom of Bahrain’s 
resilience to climate change. For that purpose, the document has the 
following four objectives: 
1. 
To systematically describe what adaptation to the adverse 
impacts of climate change means in Bahrain and to identify objectives 
for adaptation (situational analysis), 
2. 
To identify interventions to increase resilience to climate change 
and achieve the objectives for adaptation (project pipeline), 
3. 
To identify relevant options of how to finance these 
interventions (finance strategy) 
4. 
To identify the stakeholders in the different areas affected by the 
adverse impacts of climate change on which successful adaptation will 
depend (stakeholder analysis),  
5. 
To prescribe institutional arrangements across different 
departments and agencies to implement the identified interventions. 
 
 
5 
Coastal Zones 
Coastal Resilience to Sea-Level Rise has been included in the Ministry 
of Works Dredging and Land Reclamation Technical Manual published 
in 2008. Some adaptation measures have already taken place and a code 
of height was implemented. However, in early 2020 and in harmony 
with the recent IPCC reviewed scenarios, the code was revised, and a 
new height was enacted to provide better costal resilience to important 
infrastructures. following these stages:  
1)         Stage one: Base lining flood risk from Sea Level Rise: Review of 
available scientific evidence and data on SLR and preliminary 
assessment of land and key assets at risk. 
2) 
Stage two: Sources of Coastal Flood Risk: Detailed investigation 
of sources of flood Risk associated with SLR and storm events. 
3) 
Stage three: Impacts on National Infrastructure: Detailed 
assessment of the impact of SLR on key infrastructure & National 
Assets 
4) 
Stage 4: Success Strategy Development of master plan and 
strategy to mitigate impacts and identification of options and actions. 
Water 
Resources 
The current water situation in Bahrain is not sustainable. The National 
Water Resources Council was reactivated in 2016 and is working on 
formulating a clear, comprehensive, and integrated water resources 
policy and strategy in order to manage water resources efficiently and 
diversify its sources through investigating novel technologies linked to 
renewable energy. 
The Water Resources Management Unit (WRM), established in 2019 
with initial funding from the GCF, aims to enhance climate resilience of 
the water sector. Among the projects undertaken by the unit is the 
modeling of the impact of climate change on freshwater resources, 
benefiting from gray water, conducting a comprehensive auditing of 
water management and use, as well as rainwater harvesting. 
 
 
 
 
6 
Bahrain also adopted and implements national disaster risk reduction strategies in line 
with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.  
 
Adaptation Actions with Mitigation Co-Benefits  
 
Beyond “classical” adaptation actions, Article 4.7 in the PA states that “Mitigation co-
benefits resulting from Parties’ adaptation actions and/or economic diversification can 
contribute to mitigation outcomes. Henceforth Bahrain launched several projects that 
concurs this concept such as: 
National Plan 
for 
Afforestation 
The national project for afforestation, to support increase green areas 
at the kingdom, better accommodate rise in temperatures and create 
green sinks for emission is still at early stages,  
A thermal satellite imagery of Bahrain has been taken to identify the 
heat hotspots, a list of trees and vegetation that are suitable for 
Bahrain’s climate, compatible with heat, does not require a lot of water 
and does not impact infrastructure was identified, a pilot program has 
been established to test the reduction impact of afforestation in 
different areas prior to expanding the projects. 
The action plan will be expanded to include the type and percentage 
of green area, as well as initiatives to encourage nationals and 
residents to plant trees and a revision of building permits to include 
landscaping 
Mangrove 
Habitats 
There are several adaptation strategies that are under consideration to 
build resilience against climate change risks mangroves habitats are 
facing while at the same time considering natural sinks. Those 
strategies are the following: 
- Establishing the Tubli Bay observatory to strengthen existing 
observation systems to better understand ecological services 
provided by mangrove habitats in the area. 
 
 
7 
- Creating a blue carbon inventory to augment Bahrain’s existing 
GHG emission tracking system to estimate and document 
carbon pools/fluxes in Tubli Bay consistent with international 
methodological guidance. 
- Ecosystem services valuation to introduce economic valuation 
as a basis to account for the value of the market (i.e., tourism) 
and non-market (i.e., regulating, provisioning, supporting) 
services that the Tubli Bay mangrove habitats provide. 
- Mangrove Transplantation Project is ongoing with more than 
4,800 seedlings being planted in 2019 alone. 
 
Bahrain will actively pursue the synergies between mitigation and adaptation exploring 
adaptation actions with mitigation benefits and vice versa.  
 
Economic Development and Diversification 
 
Bahrain Bourse (Bahrain Stock Market) joined the Sustainable Stock Exchange (SSE) 
initiative in 2019, reinforcing its commitment to promote sustainable and transparent 
capital markets. Companies in Bahrain will have to disclose Environmental, Social, and 
Governance (ESG) information, and are expected to create shared value and inclusive 
growth, to assess their impacts on capitals and resources, and to contribute to national, 
regional and global visions and plans. 
In addition, the Government has adopted a strategic plan to develop six key economic 
sectors, namely financial services, information and communication technology, industry, 
logistics, tourism, and oil. Several initiatives have been implemented to increase the 
volume of foreign and local investments and create job opportunities. Many initiatives 
have already been implemented such as a new tourism strategy, new measures to 
streamline visa procedures, new legislation to encourage foreign investors, a 
comprehensive strategy for the development of the logistics sector, and a national 
strategy to revive the pearling industry.  
These initiatives will continue to contribute to positive growth in the Kingdom’s non-oil 
sector, strengthening its contribution to GDP, increasing sustainable development and 
 
 
8 
further enhancing diversification while reinforcing the pivotal role of the private sector 
as the major driver of growth.  
The Kingdom of Bahrain strives to avoid and reduce emissions in its economic 
development. As per Article 4.7 of the Paris Agreement, at the core of this NDC is 
mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification 
plans. 
 
Sustainable Development Goals  
The Kingdom of Bahrain has taken major steps towards achieving the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations General Assembly, aligning its 
national development agenda accordingly.  
As a result, the Kingdom of Bahrain has established many governmental institutions, 
organizations, and committees to develop the programs, policies, and strategies to 
achieve sustainability in its various dimensions. It has also enacted a number of laws and 
regulations related to the achievement of sustainable development, which has become an 
international demand in the midst of the current economic, political and social changes 
that the global community witnesses currently. 
 
Means of Implementation 
 
The elaboration of this NDC includes a public participatory process through a series of 
multi- sectorial meetings and has been reviewed by the National Climate Change 
Committee. This intended contribution is communicated under the assumption of the 
adoption of a universal, legally binding instrument that fully respects the principles and 
provisions of the UNFCCC, in particular the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities, equity, and respective capabilities. The domestic actions communicated 
in this NDC are voluntary and will be implemented in accordance with the principles 
and provisions of the Convention, in particular Article 4 paragraph 1, 7 and 8.  
The Kingdom of Bahrain recognizes that the extent to which it will meet its obligations 
under the UNFCCC, PA will depend highly on the level of international support in 
means of implementation. Therefore, mitigation and adaptation stipulations are meant 
to inform and will be undertaken in the context of support on finance, technology-
transfer, and capacity building. 
 
 
9 
 
 
Information Necessary for Clarity, Transparency, and Understanding of 
the updated NDC 
 
Bahrain will periodically review the mitigation and adaptation measures mentioned in 
the NDCs to ensure that efforts are implemented.  
Bahrain will have a specific monitoring and evaluation plan for the adaptation, for 
monitoring and reviewing and verification of projects and policies.  
 
Article 6 
 
In implementation of its NDC, Bahrain will consider voluntary cooperation and 
cooperative approaches that involve the use of internationally transferred mitigation 
outcomes as per Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. For the Kingdom of Bahrain such 
cooperation and cooperative approaches will be multi-metric in their nature and include 
not only GHG but also other related parameters such as renewable energy, energy 
efficiency etc. 
 
Technology Innovation and Deployment 
 
The Kingdom of Bahrain considers technology innovation and deployment at scale as a 
vital enabler of its NDC and for achieving the Paris Agreement goals. Bahrain supports 
key technologies such as carbon capture and utilization, direct air capture and others 
which are necessary for hard-to-abate sectors. 
 
 
Response measures 
 
The Kingdom of Bahrain is impacted not only by physical climate change consequences   
but also the negative result of climate change policies made beyond its borders. Managing 
response measures to minimize their economic and social consequence in Bahrain is one 
of the key priorities for Bahrain to achieve sustainable growth. 
 
 
10 
As outlined in Article 4.15 of the Paris Agreement, the international community needs to 
take into account economies most affected by the impacts of response measures, 
particularly developing country Parties. 
 
Ambition and fairness 
 
Given its small island and developing country status, historically low GHG footprint 
(estimated as approximately below 0.1% of the global GHG footprint), ongoing economic 
diversification, physical impacts of climate change, the Kingdom of Bahrain considers 
this NDC as ambitious and fair. To correctly utilize its limited resources, Bahrain will 
prioritize adaptation actions (especially those with mitigation co-benefits) over 
mitigation.

NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 
of the Republic of Belarus to the reduction of  
greenhouse gas emissions until 2030 
CHAPTER 1  
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Pursuant to Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, the NDC makes provision for the 
commitment of the Republic of Belarus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
2030 with due regard for the timeframe for updating greenhouse gas emissions 
targets according to paragraph 9 of this Article and further guidance in relation 
to the mitigation section of Decision 1/CP.21 dealing with climate change 
mitigation (hereinafter Guidance), adopted in 2018 by Decision 4/CMA.1 of the 
Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change of May 9, 1992 (hereinafter referred to as Framework 
Convention) serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. 
The Republic of Belarus supports the collective efforts of the Parties to the Paris 
Agreement aimed at keeping the increase in global average temperature to well 
below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and is making efforts to limit 
its increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is consistent with the goal of the Paris 
Agreement. 
In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions (hereinafter referred to as “INDC”), in accordance with the position 
approved by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus of November 
16, 2015 No. 461, the Republic of Belarus committed to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 28 per cent by 2030 as compared to the 1990 level, 
excluding the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector (hereinafter 
referred to as “LULUCF”) and without any additional conditions. The 
commitment did not imply using international carbon market mechanisms or 
mobilizing foreign financial resources for the implementation of the best 
available technologies.  
The Republic of Belarus intends to make a more ambitious contribution in the 
global response to climate change and sets economy-wide unconditional and 
conditional greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. 
Taking into account the economic situation and the country's capabilities, the new 
unconditional economy-wide target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at 
least 35 per cent from the 1990 level by 2030, inclusive of the LULUCF sector.  
 
 
The new conditional economy-wide target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by at least 40 per cent from the 1990 level by 2030, inclusive of the LULUCF 
sector and subject to using international financing mechanisms to introduce the 
best available technologies for achieving greenhouse gas emissions reduction. 
The dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions exclusive of the LULUCF sector 
during 1990-2018 and the commitment until 2030 are shown in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1. Greenhouse gas emissions in 1990-2018 and commitment until 2030 
CHAPTER 2 
QUANTIFIABLE INFRORMATION 
The year 1990 is the base year for determining the target for reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions until 2030. The level of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 was 
137.8 million tonnes of CO2-eq. exclusive of the LULUCF sector, and 117.2 
million tonnes of CO2-eq. inclusive of the LULUCF sector. 
The type of commitment is the absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
until 2030 as compared to the base year emissions, inclusive of the LULUCF 
sector. 
The unconditional target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least        
35 per cent. 
The conditional target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least        
40 per cent. 
The year 2018 was chosen as the base year for generating emission projections 
and accounting for greenhouse gas reduction policy and measures until 2030.

The basic data sources for making greenhouse gas emission projections are the 
National Inventory Report on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals 
by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol of 
September 16, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as “National Inventory Report”) for 
1990 - 2018; the Fourth Biennial Report of the Republic of Belarus (2019); and 
the national communications of the Republic of Belarus according to the 
commitments under the Framework Convention.  
The greenhouse gas inventory process is being continuously improved, which 
may lead to changes in the time-series indicators, including the base year of 1990. 
The projected greenhouse gas emissions were calculated following the 2006 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as “IPCC”) 
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the parameters used in 
the preparation of inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and 
removals by sinks of greenhouse gases. 
CHAPTER 3 
TIME FRAME 
The target will be achieved during the period from January 1, 2021 to      
December 31, 2030. 
The year 2030 is set as the target year for the commitment to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions, taking into account the National Strategy for Sustainable Socio-
Economic Development of the Republic of Belarus until 2030 adopted by the 
Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus 
(minutes of the meeting on May 2, 2017, No. 10). 
Achievement of the target will be monitored in the Biennial Transparency 
Reports submitted by the Republic of Belarus, National Communications and 
other reporting documents in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the 
decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties. 
CHAPTER 4 
SCOPE AND COVERAGE 
The NDC includes economic sectors and categories of anthropogenic emissions 
by sources and removal by sinks consistent with those contained in the National 
GHG Inventory Report for 1990-2018, INDC, and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (hereinafter referred to as “Guidelines”). 
Taking into account the national methodology and the reporting requirements 
stipulated in the Guidelines, the commitments of the Republic of Belarus refer to 
 
greenhouse gas emissions in the following sectors: Energy, Industrial Processes 
and Product Use (hereinafter referred to as “IPPU”), Agriculture, Waste, and 
LULUCF. 
The LULUCF sector was not included in the INDC due to high uncertainty in the 
methodology of estimating greenhouse gas emissions and removals. This sector 
is included in the NDC, considering its potential as a carbon dioxide sink and all 
possible risks. 
Maximum greenhouse gas emissions are associated with fuel combustion and 
other processes in the Energy sector, which accounts for 62 per cent of the total 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. The Agriculture sector accounts for 24 per 
cent of the total greenhouse gas emissions; the IPPU and Waste sectors account 
each for 7 per cent in 2018.  
Data on the absolute emissions in the listed sectors exclusive of the LULUCF 
sector is given in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. Dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions by sector 
The commitments of the Republic of Belarus are related to the reduction of the 
emissions of the following greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous 
oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride.  
The major greenhouse gas in Belarus is carbon dioxide. In 2018, the share of 
carbon dioxide was 67.3 per cent of the total greenhouse gas emissions (exclusive 
of net sinks in the LULUCF sector), the share of methane was 17.5 per cent, and 
the share of nitrous oxide was 15.2 per cent.

Emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride are negligible at 
0.0038 per cent of the total greenhouse gas emissions.  
Pursuant to paragraph 31 (c) of Decision 1/CP.21 by the Conference of Parties to 
the Framework Convention, the Republic of Belarus included the LULUCF 
sector in the NDC and continues to make efforts to identify all categories of 
sources and sinks of anthropogenic emissions, as well as to assess emissions in 
the sources that are currently not accounted for in the NDC. 
The geographic coverage coincides with the geopolitical borders of the country. 
During the establishment of the NDC, the implementation of climate change 
adaptation measures was not taken into account. 
CHAPTER 5 
PLANNING PROCESSES 
Pursuant to Article 4 of the Paris Agreement, the Republic of Belarus pledged to 
submit an NDC every five years to the Secretariat of the Framework Convention, 
and pursuant to Article 14 of the Paris Agreement, the global stocktake outcome 
is used to inform the NDCs. 
The climate change legislation of the Republic of Belarus is governed by the laws 
of the Republic of Belarus of November 26, 1992, No. 1982-XII “On 
Environmental 
Protection”,

and other regulatory legal acts. 
Key approaches in the field of sustainable forest management, which make it 
possible to preserve their ecological and economic balance, are laid down in the 
Forest Code of the Republic of Belarus and the Strategic Plan for the 
Development of the Forestry Sector for 2015-2030 approved by the Deputy 
Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus on December 23, 2014,        
No. 06/201 271. 
Pursuant to the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No. 345 of 
September 20, 2016 “On the Adoption of an International Treaty”, the Ministry 
of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection of the Republic of Belarus 
(hereinafter referred to as “MNREP”) was designated as the body responsible for 
the implementation of the commitments undertaken by the country under the 
Paris Agreement. 
 
As part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the national climate policy 
is being improved. The policy is focused on the country's sustainable 
development, and the reduction of the energy intensity and carbon intensity of 
the national economy, including with due regard for the implementation of 
Resolution 70/1 - Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development - adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on      
September 25, 2015. 
The Concept of the National Security of the Republic of Belarus adopted the 
Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus No. 575 of November 9, 2010, 
the Concept of Energy Security of the Republic of Belarus adopted by the 
Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus No. 1084 of 
December 23, 2015, the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Provisions of 
the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, approved by Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus,        
No. 06/214-53/160 of March 13, 2019 are being implemented.  
The NDC will be achieved in accordance with the Strategy for Environmental 
Protection of the Republic of Belarus until 2025 and as part of the implementation 
of the following: 
Socio-Economic Development Programme of the Republic of Belarus for      
2021-2025 adopted by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus  
No. 292 of July 29, 2021;

State Programme “Agribusiness” for 2021-2025 adopted by the Resolution of the 
Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of February 1, 2021, No. 59. 
A roadmap was developed for the implementation of the NDC in the Republic of 
Belarus with due consideration for the global trends and national context of 
Belarus, which contains actions for the five-year period as well as longer-term 
activities. 
The NDC will be the basis for the development of the Long-term Low 
Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy of the Republic of Belarus until 
2050 in terms of heat and electricity generation, and improving energy efficiency 
in the IPPU, construction, housing and utility, and transport sectors. 
Work has started in the Republic of Belarus to establish a system for assessing 
climate risks and risks related to hazardous weather events, which makes it 
possible to analyse vulnerability to climate change and to provide 
recommendations for adaptation.  
Strategic documents on the adaptation of individual economic sectors to climate 
change are being developed. In 2022, the National Action Plan for Climate 
Adaptation will be developed. 
CHAPTER 6 
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES 
In accordance with Decision 24/CP.19 of the Conference of the Parties to the 
Framework Convention, the following sources were used to formulate the NDC: 
IPCC Guidelines; 
the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC of 2007; 
GHG inventory data from the National GHG Inventory Report of the 
Republic of Belarus for 1990-2018; 
official data from central government bodies and other state-owned 
organizations subordinate to the Government of the Republic of Belarus, and 
other organizations for the year 2018; 
findings of research and development; 
scientific and research-and-practice publications. 
Detailed information on the methodology used for the preparation of the NDC 
with the description of projected greenhouse gas emissions per main source 
categories, the main factors affecting emission levels, and the indicators required 
for assessing progress towards the stated target of reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions for each of the sectors is published on the official website of the 
MNREP on the Internet. In accordance with Decision 18/CMA.1 of the 
Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris 
 
Agreement, such an assessment will be carried out by December 31, 2024, when 
the Republic of Belarus submits a progress report on the NDC implementation. 
CHAPTER 7 
FAIRNESS AND AMBITION  
The new economy-wide target of the Republic of Belarus, in comparison with 
the INDC target, provides for a further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 
an additional 7-12 per cent, which, in view of the economic situation and the 
country's capabilities, is the evidence of a more ambitious contribution. 
The Republic of Belarus - an Annex I Party to the Framework Convention - is a 
transition economy, whose per capita gross domestic product (hereinafter 
referred to as “GDP”) is lower compared to most Annex I Parties to the 
Framework Convention. In this regard, the Republic of Belarus has a limited 
ability to mobilize additional investment in low-carbon technologies and 
innovations. Thus, the target of ensuring the reduction of emissions by 35 per 
cent as compared to the 1990 level inclusive of the LULUCF sector is optimal in 
the current socio-economic context. 
The average annual GDP growth rate in 1995-2018 was 4.9 per cent, and the 
average annual increase in greenhouse gas emissions over the same period was 
0.5 per cent. Due to the targeted state policy in the field of energy saving and 
improving the energy efficiency of production, the carbon intensity of the 
economy decreased almost threefold in 1995-2018 (Figure 3). 
 
Years 
Figure 3. Dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions and GDP in 1995-2018 
In future, the Republic of Belarus intends to reduce the carbon intensity of its 
economy and raise its ambition in the next cycle of NDC reporting informed by

EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied.

(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION OF BOSNIA AND 
HERZEGOVINA (NDC) 
FOR THE PERIOD 2020-2030 
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity is facing today, as it affects all aspects 
of the environment and the economy and threatens the sustainable development of the society. 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a country where the negative effects of climate change are already visible, 
appreciates the importance of addressing this challenge and is making every effort to render these 
initiatives successful. 
GHG emissions in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2014, which is at the same time the last year for which 
the inventory was made up to now, amounted to 26,062 Gg CO2eq. GHG emissions in 2014 amounted 
to about 7.38 tons of CO2eq per capita, which is about 15% less than the average of EU countries (EU-
28) for the same year. GHG emissions per unit of GDP for BiH amounted to 1.87 kg CO2eq per euro in 
2014, while the EU average was 0.39 kg CO2eq per euro, which indicates inefficient use of resources, 
primarily energy. 
The key challenge in the process of climate change mitigation is to use the transition to a low-carbon 
(low-emission) economy for achieving the sustainable economic development and social cohesion 
goals, while taking account of the existing structure of the economy and the time required for its 
transition. Through investing in GHG emission reduction projects and programmes, there is a great 
potential for economic growth, employment opportunities and business risk reduction. 
The present document Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Bosnia and Herzegovina was 
prepared in accordance with the Decision 1/CP.21 of the Paris Agreement and it is a revision of the 
first Intended Nationally Determined Contribution – INDC submitted by Bosnia and Herzegovina in 
October 2015. Compared to the INDC, the NDC of Bosnia and Herzegovina includes a section on 
climate change adaptation and the updated section related to contribution to climate change 
mitigation which now includes more ambitious targets for reducing GHG emissions.

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 
Need to include 
climate change 
adaptation 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly vulnerable to climate change due to 
its geographical position, economic importance of the agriculture, water 
management and forestry sectors, as well as due to its limited capacity for 
climate change adaptation. According to the Climate Risk Index data for 
BiH taken from the Global Climate Risk Index, in 2014 BiH ranked third in 
terms of total losses and damage caused by climate change. Therefore, it 
is of the utmost importance to determine the impact of climate change on 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and identify priority action measures.  
Climate change 
effects 
The first three National Communications on climate change under the 
UNFCCC, as well as numerous scientific papers, have clearly indicated that 
the climate, and especially climate extremes, have changed in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina in the course of the last few decades. In the last ten years 
alone, six years have been very dry to extremely dry, and five years have 
been marked by extreme floods. During the period 2009-2019 almost all 
years were characterised by extreme weather conditions: floods in 2009, 
2010, 2014, 2018 and 2019, drought and heat waves in 2011, 2012, 2013, 
2015, 2016 and 2017, cold waves in early 2012, strong wind in mid-2012 
and late 2017, and extremely large number of hail days in 2018. 
Along with the increase in temporal variations in precipitation distribution, 
the problems related to the pronounced spatial variations are exacerbated 
– the places lacking water are actually those with the greatest water needs, 
valleys with the greatest land potential for intensive agriculture, with the 
necessary irrigation and with the highest population density. 
The most vulnerable 
sectors 
The sectors that are most vulnerable to climate change in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina include: agriculture, water resources, forestry, energy, 
tourism, biodiversity and sensitive ecosystems, and human health. The 
most vulnerable sectors are agriculture and water resources management. 
The biggest impacts are reflected in the risks of drought, floods and fires. 
Drought has been one of the most significant threats to Bosnia and 
Herzegovina in the past period, causing great economic, environmental 
and social costs. Extremely high temperatures and heat stress are some of 
the biggest problems in agriculture, especially in the sub-Mediterranean 
part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This problem has been particularly present 
in the last two decades, with the major impact on fruit, vegetable and wine 
production. In 2012, Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced a prolonged 
period of severe drought, causing losses in agricultural production of about 
BAM 1.65 billion1, grain and vegetable yields were reduced by about 70%, 
and energy production was reduced by about 25%.2   
Forecasted changes in precipitation amounts and air temperature will 
negatively affect the current water resources management system in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Changes can be expected in terms of time of 
occurrence, frequency and intensity of extreme events – floods and 
droughts. The largest increase in air temperature is predicted during the 
growing season (June, July and August), and a slightly milder increase 
during March, April and May, which will result in increased 
evapotranspiration and more pronounced extreme minimums of water

ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE 
levels on watercourses. This will result in reduction in the availability of 
water resources in the growing season when the needs are the highest, in 
terms of water quantity, but also quality, because in low water periods the 
potential and real danger of significant degradation of water quality 
increases. A significant increase in air temperature during the winter 
season (December, January and February) will result in a decrease in 
snowfall, that is, a decrease in flow in most watercourses during spring 
months. On the other hand, the expected more frequent precipitation of 
higher intensity will cause more intense runoff, often followed by floods. 
According to the data from the document Recovery Needs Assessment in 
BiH3, which was developed with the help of the EU, UN and WB, it is 
estimated that the total consequences of major floods that occurred in 
May 2014 in Bosnia and Herzegovina amount to BAM 3,982 million, that 
is, BAM 2,033 million in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, BAM 
1,893 million in Republika Srpska and BAM 58 million in the Brčko District 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Potential future 
impacts and needs 
The territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina has already been affected by many 
climate extremes: intense precipitation, heat waves, extremely high 
temperatures, droughts, floods, stormy winds, etc. Under the RCP8.5 
climate scenario, an increase in the intensity and frequency of these 
extremes can be expected in the decades to come. 
Accordingly, it is important to plan in detail the adaptation measures 
(short-term, medium-term and long-term), the method of financing the 
implementation of the proposed measures and the institutions for their 
implementation. 
It is necessary to improve the processes of monitoring, analysis and 
modelling of climate data, and to strengthen professional and institutional 
capacities. 
Climate change 
adaptation planning 
In response to the adverse consequences of climate change, in 2013 Bosnia 
and Herzegovina adopted its first Climate Change Adaptation and Low-
Emission Development Strategy, the strategic objective of which was to 
increase resilience of Bosnia and Herzegovina to climate variability and 
climate change, while preventing environmental degradation, as well as 
gradual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 
New Climate Change Adaptation and Low-Emission Development Strategy 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the period 2020-2030 is in the completion 
stage. The objective of the Strategy in the field of climate change 
adaptation is to increase the resilience of Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
climate variability and climate change, thus ensuring economic progress. 
Monitoring and 
evaluation 
Monitoring the implementation of climate change adaptation measures 
will be combined with the process of regular updating of priorities and 
sectoral adaptation plans and programmes of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The 
preparation of updated plans and programmes will be based on the 
assessment of the implementation of previous plans and programmes. In 
this round of the NDC, a framework for monitoring and evaluation of 
activities and processes of adaptation to climate change will be developed, 
with defined indicators and manners of reporting.

CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION 
Long-term goal of 
GHG emission 
reduction 
Reduction of GHG emissions compared to the baseline year 
Timeframe 
2020-2030 and by 2050 
Coverage 
In setting GHG emission reduction target, the following sectors are 
encompassed: 
• power 
• district heating 
• building  
• transport 
• industry 
• agriculture 
• forestry (through increased sinks) 
• waste 
• cross-cutting sector4 
Area (including GHG) 
NDC includes information on the following GHG gases: 
• carbon dioxide (CO2) 
• methane (CH4) 
• nitrogen suboxide (N2O) 
• hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
Baseline year 
2014 (for the purpose of comparison with INDC, reduction targets are 
given in relation to 1990 as well) 
Contribution 
(emission reduction 
level) 
The unconditional GHG emissions reduction target for 2030 is 12.8% 
compared to 2014 or 33.2% compared to 1990. The conditional target 
(with more intensive international assistance for the decarbonisation of 
mining areas) for 2030 is 17.5% compared to 2014 or 36.8% compared to 
1990. GHG emissions reduction target for 2050 is 50.0% (unconditional) 
and 55.0% (conditional) compared to 2014, that is, 61.7% (unconditional) 
and 65.6% (conditional) compared to modelling 1990. In the case of 
conditional target, more intensive international assistance is expected for 
faster decarbonisation of the power sector with an emphasis on fair 
transition of mining areas. Not all of these targets include GHG sinks. In 
the forestry sector, measures are planned to increase the sinks by 93 
GgCO2eq until 2030.  
Methodological 
approach used to 
measure and verify 
anthropogenic GHG 
emissions and their 
absorption 
The methodological approach is based on the use of the following data 
and tools: 
• 
Use of data on emissions from the official GHG inventories (1990- 
2014), data from national communications on climate change and 
biennial update reports on GHG emissions 
• 
Official statistics 
• 
Sectoral development forecasts 
• 
Modelling of GHG emissions by 2050 using the LEAP programme 
(Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System) 
            Baseline year 2014: 26,062.18 GgCO2eq (without sinks) 
            Year 1990: 34,043.49 GgCO2eq (without sinks)

            Baseline year 2014: 19,664.51 GgCO2eq (with sinks) 
            Year 1990: 26,619.90 GgCO2eq (with sinks) 
 
Fairness and ambition 
based on conditions 
in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina 
Meeting the defined targets includes the following: 
• 
Significant decarbonisation of the economy, especially power sector, 
with investments of approx. BAM 17 billion in the period until 2030, 
which is over 5% of GDP; 
• 
Cessation of the long-standing emission growth trend in the short 
term; 
• 
Ambitious reduction of GHG emissions in a relatively short period 
(2014 – 2030); 
• 
Halving of emissions by 2050 compared to 2014; 
• 
The targets imply reduction in GHG emissions by just over a third by 
2030, and almost two-thirds by 2050 compared to 1990. 
Planning process 
NDC is based on the strategic documents currently in place. When it comes 
to implementation, the existing institutional framework is used along with 
its strengthening. 
Monitoring and 
reporting 
 
Based on the principles of the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) 
using the existing institutional framework along with its strengthening. 
International market 
mechanisms 
Out of the mechanisms in place, potentially in the EU ETS for achieving the 
conditional target. In future mechanisms depending on the EU accession 
process and the market mechanism conditions. 
  
CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION – BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1. 
Current emissions 
As a member of the UNFCCC, BiH is required to report on GHG emissions. Through the development 
of the first three National Communications and two Biennial Update Reports on GHG emissions, 
inventories of emissions from 1990 to 2014 were made. The inventories were made by applying the 
1996 IPCC methodology. The development of inventories for 2015 and 2016 is in progress by applying 
the 2006 IPCC methodology, and their completion is planned for the first quarter of 2021. With this in 
mind, information on GHG emissions is much more reliable compared to the period when the INDC 
was produced, and, in addition, the national capacities for their monitoring have been improved. This 
enabled more reliable emission projections and thus the definition of the targets arising from 
international treaties. Error! Reference source not found.  shows the GHG emission trend from 1990

Figure 1: Annual GHG emissions in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
The highest emissions were recorded in 1990 and they amounted to 34,040GgCO2eq. The emissions 
were significantly reduced during the 1992-1995 period, after which they started increasing. In 2001, 
they amounted to 12,030GgCO2eq, which is just over one third compared to 1990. Subsequently, 
primarily due to the growth of emissions in the energy sector, total emissions exceeded 
20,000GgCO2eq (in 2008). Emissions from other sectors were more than halved between 1990 and 
2001, due to a reduction of more than 80% in industrial emissions and 50% in the agricultural sector. 
The highest emissions after 1990 were recorded in 2011 and they amounted to 28,107GgCO2eq, which 
is about 83% of 1990 emissions. The rise in emissions in 2011 primarily occurred due to increased 
power generation from coal-fired power plants. Year 2012 saw a significant drop in emissions as a 
result of a smaller share of thermal power plants in power generation. Emissions in 2014, the last year 
for which the inventory has been made to date, amounted to 26,062GgCO2eq, which is about 23.5% 
less compared to 1990. 
Based on the analysis of emissions per capita, emissions in 2010 almost reached the levels of emissions 
per capita in 1990 (5.18 tons of CO2eq per capita annually in 2008), however they are still among the 
lowest values in Europe. In 2014, emissions per capita amounted to about 7.38 tons of CO2eq, which is 
about 15% less than the EU average. However, if a comparison is made in relation to gross domestic 
product, emissions in BiH are nearly five times higher than in the EU. GHG emissions per unit of GDP 
for BiH amounted to 1.87 kg CO2eq per euro in 2014, while the EU average was 0.39 kg CO2eq per euro. 
These statistical data illustrate the economic and social situation of BiH, which is trapped in poverty, 
with relatively low GHG emissions, but even lower per capita gross domestic product, which indicates 
inefficient use of resources, primarily energy.

Figure 2: Shares of GHG emissions by sectors 
The diagram shows the increase of the share of energy generation in total GHG emissions from 61% 
(in 1990) to 64% (in 2014), although emissions in this sector are lower in 2014 by about 5,500 GgCO2eq 
compared to 1990. There is a significant increase in the share of transport, from 7% to 12%. The share 
of agriculture records a significant drop, while the share of industry remained pretty much the same. 
The share of fugitive emissions from fuels dropped from 5% in 1990 to 2% in 2014. It is important to 
emphasise that this is the share in emissions of all greenhouse gases, and not just carbon dioxide 
emissions. 
Creating a GHG emissions inventory resulted in the increased level of data reliability. Verification of 
calculations was made in terms of the procedures to be followed in data collection and inventory 
development. 
The quantity of emissions from 1990 has not yet been reached. It is evident that emission levels have 
started to rise, due to increased industrial activities, and generally they have an increasing trend. 
2. 
Emission reduction targets 
When setting GHG emission reduction targets, it should be taken into account that BiH is a signatory 
to the Paris Agreement and a member of the Energy Community. Under the Paris Agreement, emission 
reduction targets are set on a voluntary basis. This means that it is up to each country to consider its 
own situation and assess which level of emission reductions is in line with its sustainable development. 
Thereby, it can be expected for the level of international assistance on reducing GHG emissions to be 
commensurate with the ambition of the targets. As a member of the Energy Community, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina has an obligation to harmonise its energy sector with the acquis communautaire and to 
base its climate targets on those of the EU, but it also has the possibility to set its own target with an 
adequate explanation of the ambitiousness of such target. When setting the target for reducing GHG 
emissions by 2030, the commitments of BiH deriving from both treaties/agreements were taken into 
account. 
In setting GHG emission reduction target, the following sectors are covered: power sector, district 
heating, building, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry (through increased sinks), waste and the 
cross-cutting5 sector. The following GHGs were considered: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide

and hydrofluorocarbons. The period for which the reduction target is defined is by 2030 and by 2050, 
with the indication of the target for 2025.  
In consultations with the Secretariat of the Energy Community, year 2014 was selected as the baseline 
year. This is the last year for which there is the official inventory of GHG emissions. It should be noted 
that in that year, BiH suffered catastrophic floods, which was reflected in the level of economic 
activities and indirectly caused certain reduction in GHG emissions. In order to be able to compare the 
reduction target with the INDC targets, the target is also expressed in relation to the 1990 emissions.  
Based on consultations with key stakeholders, the GHG emissions reduction target has been set such 
to leave room for the construction of planned substitute/new coal-fired power plants with a total 
capacity of 1,050 MW6 until 2030. This is 350 MW more than envisaged by the moderate renewable 
scenario in the Framework Energy Strategy of BiH until 2035; however, it is less compared to the other 
three scenarios from the same Strategy. Compared to the scenario of the Entity working groups, the 
installed capacity of the new coal-fired power plants envisaged by this document is lower by 1,600 
MW, and compared to the scenario of optimised/least-cost indicative plan, it is lower by 400 MW. 
Construction of substitute thermal power plants is justified by the need for gradual decarbonisation 
of mining areas. It takes much more than 10 years to create a sufficient number of job posts in non-
coal-related activities. The option with 750 MW of substitute and new coal-fired power plants was 
also analysed, which implies more intensive international assistance on decarbonisation with an 
additional focus on assistance in fair transition of mining areas. This option implies the construction 
of another thermal power plant next to block 7 in the Tuzla thermal power plant. Meeting the targets 
in both options is dependent on receiving international assistance and participation in international 
financial mechanisms for reducing GHG emissions. 
The unconditional target of reducing GHG emissions for 2030 is 12.8% (excluding GHG sinks) compared 
to 2014. The conditional target (with more intensive international assistance, especially for the fair 
transition of mining areas) for 2030 is 17.7% (excluding GHG sinks) compared to 2014. An overview of 
GHG emission reduction targets of BiH compared to the emissions from 2014 and 1990 is shown in 
Table 1 and 2.

The 
diagram 
above 
(
 
) shows the cessation of the two and a half decade long trend of emissions growth until 2020, which 
is a consequence of limiting the number of operating hours for the most inefficient coal-fired thermal 
power plants and the commissioning of a certain number of RES plants. However, this is sufficient only 
to stop the growth trend. The decrease in emissions begins with the commissioning of more efficient 
thermal power plants, which enables decommissioning of a number of existing thermal power plants. 
In parallel, the resources of the mines will be gradually used for the production of RES (biomass 
cultivation, space for solar power plants, etc.). Measures are also being implemented in other sectors, 
especially in the building sector: reducing the use of coal and heating oil with the implementation of 
energy efficiency measures to reduce heating and cooling needs, increasing the efficiency of heating 
and cooling systems, energy efficiency labelling and banning imports of used heating and cooling 
equipment, etc. Reform of the incentive system for RES will be aimed at encouraging the 
decentralisation of the energy system and the implementation of community energy projects. Under 
the unconditional target option, the emission reduction after 2025 is milder than in the conditional 
target option because more power is generated in the new coal-fired power plants (1,050 MW vs. 750 
MW). Emissions in 2030 according to the unconditional target amount to 22,726 Gg CO2eq, which is by 
12.8% less compared to 2014. In the same year, according to the conditional target, emissions are 
21,501 Gg CO2eq, which is by 17.5% less compared to 2014. Emissions in 2050 according to the 
unconditional target amount to 13,031 Gg CO2eq, which is by 50.0% less than in 2014. In the same year, 
according to the conditional target, the emissions amount to 11,728 Gg CO2eq, which is by 55.0% less 
than in 2014. It is very important to emphasise that both targets are characterised by the following: 
• 
Cessation of the long-standing emission growth trend in the short term, 
• 
Ambitious reduction of GHG emissions in a relatively short period (2014 – 2030) and 
• 
Halving of emissions by 2050 compared to 2014 
In addition, it is important to point out that the presented targets mean a reduction in GHG emissions 
for slightly more than one third by 2030, and almost two thirds (about 66%) by 2050 compared to 
1990. Taking into account the size of the GHG sinks in 2014 and emissions according to the conditional 
target in 2050, net emissions in 2050 would amount to around 5,330 Gg CO2eq, which is about 80% 
less compared to the net emissions in 1990.

In order to achieve the defined targets, it is necessary to implement measures that are demanding 
both in terms of planning and finances. In order to achieve the targets in both options (unconditional 
and conditional target), Bosnia and Herzegovina will need a strong international assistance for 
capacity building, training, technology transfer, establishment of financial mechanisms to encourage 
decarbonisation, preparation of necessary research and project documentation, as well as project 
financing itself. In case of the option that defines the conditional target due to faster decarbonisation 
of the power sector (which requires a higher level of effort on decarbonisation of mining areas), 
international assistance should be more intensive.  
The fulfilment of the foregoing defined and described targets will greatly depend on the development 
of the situation regarding the COVID-19 virus pandemic, which can have a significant impact on the 
entire economy.

Brunei Darussalam 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 2020 
 
Brunei Darussalam is no exception to being impacted by the effects of climate change as the rest 
of the world - believing that the challenges posed by climate change demand urgent, decisive and 
concerted global action.  
 
Brunei Darussalam hereby communicates its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and 
relevant information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding in accordance to decision 
1/CP.21, paragraph 27 as contained in Annex 1 of decision 4/CMA.1. 
 
This NDC supersedes the INDC and has been developed in an inclusive Whole-of-Nation process 
through the instituted national climate change governance. It sets a new ambition level which 
includes an economy-wide 2030 NDC target based on clear climate mitigation, resilience and 
adaptation policies.  
 
However, limitations resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, have posed challenges in the 
preparation of this NDC, which may be updated in due course should there be new findings from 
further assessments. 
 
Brunei Darussalam is committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 20% relative to Business-As-Usual levels by 2030.

4. Planning process 
(a) Information on the planning processes that the Party undertook to prepare its NDC and, if 
available, on the Party’s implementation plans, including, as appropriate:  
i) 
Domestic institutional 
arrangements, public 
participation and 
engagement with local 
communities and 
indigenous peoples, in 
a gender-responsive 
manner;  
Brunei Darussalam has established a multi-sectoral climate 
change institutional governance to ensure a Whole-of-Nation 
approach in addressing the challenges and opportunities of 
climate change at a national level. 
 
The climate change governance structure consists of the 
Brunei Darussalam National Council on Climate Change, 
Executive Committee on Climate Change, Mitigation Working 
Group, Adaptation and Resilience Working Group, and 
Support Framework Working Group. 
 
The Brunei Darussalam National Council on Climate Change 
comprises of four key ministers and a deputy minister and it 
is co-chaired by the Honourable Minister of Development and 
the Honourable Minister of Energy to provide the highest level 
of strategic direction in addressing climate change. The 
Executive Committee on Climate Change is composed of 
Permanent Secretaries of key government agencies, Chief 
Executive Officers and Managing Directors of industry 
operators, Presidents of professional associations, academia 
and non-governmental organisations to drive national climate 
mitigation, adaptation and support efforts.  
 
The Mitigation Working Group, Adaptation and Resilience 
Working Group, and Support Framework Working Group 
respectively consist of members from the private and public 
sectors, 
non-government 
organisations 
and academia 
institutions to execute climate action in each respective area.  
 
The varying levels of membership ensures a multi-sectoral 
collaborative process to approach climate change mitigation, 
adaptation, resilience and support. 
ii) Contextual matters, 
including, inter alia, as 
appropriate:  
  
a) National 
circumstances, 
such as geography, 
climate, economy, 
sustainable 
development and 
poverty 
eradication;  
Despite Brunei Darussalam’s relatively small contribution to 
the global GHG emissions at around 0.025% in 2018, the 
Sultanate is affected by adverse impacts of climate change. 
The Government recognises the importance to present a fair 
and ambitious NDC while considering the country’s national 
circumstances as a developing country, which include: an oil 
and natural gas economy; the prioritisation of forested areas; 
fossil fuel dependency; and vulnerability to a low carbon 
world. This is fully consistent with Article 3 paragraph 2 and 
Article 4 paragraph 8(h) and 10 of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. 
 
Brunei Darussalam continues to pursue policies that are in line 
with its national development plan, the Wawasan Brunei 2035 
(Brunei Vision 2035), which aims to make the Nation widely 
recognised for its educated and highly skilled people as 
 
 
 
 
Page 4 of 14 
 
measured by the highest international standards; achieving 
and maintaining quality of life among the top 10 nations in 
the world; and operating under a dynamic and sustainable 
economy with income per capita within the top 10 countries 
in the world. The priority of Wawasan Brunei 2035 is to 
safeguard the welfare of Bruneian citizens, which includes 
plans to ensure a clean, green and healthy environment.  
 
The Government of Brunei Darussalam recognises the need 
for a more balanced economy by identifying growth areas in 
the country to promote the development of other sectors in 
addition to energy. These include the financial and service 
industries, which will diversify the economy to ensure future 
economic stability. Promoting sustainability within the current 
economy is also a priority for the Government of Brunei 
Darussalam. This approach is further re-enforced by strong 
“top-down” support from His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-
Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam in many areas of the economy, 
and through “bottom-up” approaches to activities such as 
awareness raising on climate change in schools and 
communities.  
 
The Government of Brunei Darussalam will continue efforts to 
develop plans to address the adverse impacts of unusual and 
extreme weather and climate events. 
 
Brunei Darussalam will continue to pursue green growth for 
sustainability and resilience so as to achieve Brunei 
Darussalam’s national target whilst remaining economically 
dependent.  
b) Best practices and 
experience related 
to the preparation 
of the nationally 
determined 
contribution;  
In preparation for the NDC, extensive consultations and peer 
reviews have been conducted with relevant stakeholders. An 
NDC Workshop was organised in 2018, to give relevant 
stakeholders a more detailed understanding of the NDC 
process itself and to assist in the preparation of the NDC.  
 
Brunei Darussalam’s main priority in the preparation of the 
NDC is developing the Brunei Darussalam National Climate 
Change Policy (BNCCP) which was launched on 25 July 2020 
that outlines the principles, values, and strategies needed to 
pave the way for low carbon and climate-resilient pathways 
for a sustainable nation. This BNCCP serves as the basis of 
Brunei Darussalam’s NDC. 
 
The BNCCP was developed using a Whole-of-Nation approach 
to strategically govern and monitor GHG emissions and 
strengthen climate-resilience. Towards this, ten core national 
strategies were identified. These strategies are to be achieved 
in line with Wawasan Brunei 2035 and cover areas pertaining 
to industrial emissions, forest cover, electric vehicles, 
renewable energy, power management, carbon pricing, 
waste management, carbon inventory, climate resilience and 
adaptation, and climate awareness and education.

A total of 39 agencies, consisting of government bodies, 
private sector agencies, research and academic institutions, 
and Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) were appointed 
as members of the BNCCP Drafting Committee.  
 
Further to that, a group of 51 youth representatives 
comprising of those between the ages of 25 to 40 were invited 
to review the BNCCP draft.  
 
The varying levels of participation and involvement ensures a 
multi-sectoral approach to climate change mitigation, 
adaptation and support. 
 
Youths and NGOs are regularly engaged in climate change 
dialogues with ministers and policymakers and for reviews of 
the BNCCP. Youths have an equally important role to play as 
the next generation inheriting the responsibility to protect the 
planet, in fighting the complex scientific problems, social 
quandaries and impacts presented by climate change. The 
Government of Brunei Darussalam continues to support 
youths towards becoming resilient to the challenges of 
climate change by enhancing their effective participation in 
climate policy decision-making processes for them to express 
their views and to contribute effectively to solutions to 
mitigate climate change.  
 
Brunei Darussalam continues to plan, discuss and implement 
climate action through the national climate change 
governance.

Accompanying information on Brunei Darussalam’s Climate Mitigation and Climate Adaptation and 
Resilience Efforts, based on the Brunei Darussalam National Climate Change Policy (BNCCP). 
1.0 
Climate Mitigation  
Brunei Darussalam will be implementing measures that will mitigate the impact of climate change 
by introducing strategies to reduce GHG emissions:  
 
1.1 
BNCCP Strategy 1 on Industrial Emissions - Reduce overall emissions in the Industrial 
Sector. 
 
Brunei Darussalam aims to lower carbon intensity from the industries by attaining zero-
routine flaring, as defined by the World Bank standard. The main focus for the BNCCP is 
to reduce industrial emissions in general by 2035. The significant reduction in total fugitive 
emissions, mainly venting and flaring will be attributed by a number of rejuvenation 
projects within the oil and gas industry facilities for GHG abatement, both onshore and 
offshore. The primary goal of this strategy is to achieve zero-routine flaring and reducing 
other industrial emissions by adopting the “As Low As Reasonably Possible” (ALARP) 
principle.  
 
1.2 
BNCCP Strategy 2 on Forest Cover - Increase carbon sink through afforestation and 
reforestation with a target of planting 500,000 new trees. 
 
Increasing Brunei Darussalam’s forest cover would increase the national carbon 
sequestration potential, thus having positive effects on habitats, biodiversity and 
ecosystems. Brunei Darussalam is home to one of the most diverse and complex 
ecosystems in the world. Forest cover in the country constitutes to about 72.1% of land 
area or 380,000 hectares of land accounting for a carbon sequestration value of 11.4 Mt 
CO2e. Brunei Darussalam aims to increase its forest reserves from 41% to 55%. Current 
efforts seek to increase Brunei Darussalam’s carbon sink through reforestation efforts. At 
present, 104,920 trees are identified for current reforestation efforts, and a further 
400,000 trees are proposed leading up to 2035.  
 
1.3 
BNCCP Strategy 3 on Electric Vehicles - Increase total share of electric vehicles (EV) to 60% 
of the total annual vehicle sales by 2035. 
 
This strategy seeks to promote the ownership of EV through the consideration of various 
policy related issues such as, but not limited to, the following: price of fuel and electricity; 
low EV prices (e.g. through excise duty incentives); annual Vehicle License (VL) fees; and 
availability of infrastructures (e.g. charging stations). The establishment of the Electric 
Vehicle Joint Task Force (EVJTF) in 2019 consisting of relevant stakeholders will ensure 
the implementation of EV policy. Land transportation currently contributes about 13.6% of 
the total GHG emissions from the energy sector. In 2020, there are over 253,000 active 
private vehicles in Brunei Darussalam. There has been a steady increase in the number of 
gasoline and diesel vehicles in Brunei Darussalam since 2009. EVs are a viable 
transportation option for Brunei Darussalam as travelling pattern is primarily of short-
distance with relatively inexpensive electricity for charging. 
 
1.4 
BNCCP Strategy 4 on Renewable Energy - Increase total share of renewable energy to at 
least 30% of total capacity in the power generation mix by 2035. 
 
Ensuring smooth transition towards a nationwide adoption and use of renewable energy 
technologies mainly solar photovoltaic (PV) will be critical to Brunei Darussalam in 
achieving its NDC. Currently, the only renewable energy source comes from a 1.2 MW 
 
 
 
 
Page 11 of 14 
 
solar PV power plant, Tenaga Suria Brunei, located in Seria, Belait District accounting for 
about 0.14% of the total power generation mix. Solar PV is the most viable option in Brunei 
Darussalam due to significant solar radiance (sunlight) available throughout the country. 
The utilisation of renewable energy would further diversify the country’s energy mix and 
reduces reliance on fossil fuels.  
 
1.5 
BNCCP Strategy 5 on Power Management - Reduce GHG emissions by at least 10% through 
better supply and demand management of electricity consumption by 2035. 
 
Reducing GHG emissions contribution from the power sector would be achieved by 
increasing energy efficiency and conservation at both supply and demand side. Increasing 
the efficiency in power generation can be done through the reduction of partial load 
operation, improvement of transmission and distribution losses, implementation of 
minimum efficiency of 48% for all new power plants, and reduction of gas consumption 
through the integration of renewable and alternative energy so as to meet domestic power 
demand. Maximising clean electricity resources to supplement domestic demand 
encourages an equitable distribution of wealth aid aiming towards a sustainable future.  
 
1.6 
BNCCP Strategy 6 on Carbon Pricing - Impose price on carbon emissions for industrial 
sector. 
 
The introduction of carbon pricing applicable to all industrial facilities emitting beyond a 
carbon emissions limit threshold at a carbon price per CO2e, by 2025. A carbon pricing 
scheme would act as a deterrent for excess GHG emissions. The Strategy also seeks to 
establish of a proper Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system as to ensure 
accuracy and credibility in baseline emissions data for imposing carbon pricing. 
 
1.7 
BNCCP Strategy 7 on Waste Management - Reduce municipal waste to landfills to 
1kg/person/day by 2035. 
 
Minimising the amount of waste that needs to be disposed of through the adoption of best 
practices and innovative technologies.  
 
1.8 
BNCCP Strategy 9 on Carbon Inventory - Mandatory monthly and annual reporting of 
carbon inventory. 
 
To develop and implement a national directive to all facilities and agents that emit and 
absorb GHG to report their GHG data to promote transparency and robustness in the 
national GHG emissions and sinks data. In ensuring the nation’s accountability and 
responsibility to provide transparency through monitoring upholds the notion of a climate-
resilient nation.

Overview of the Impacts of Climate Change on Brunei Darussalam 
Brunei Darussalam is located on the North Coast of the island of Borneo with a population of 
442,400 over a total geographical land size of 5,765 km2. As a small, coastal area with a tropical 
equatorial climate, vulnerability assessments have shown that the country has medium to high 
climate change exposure. Brunei Darussalam’s coastal areas are low-lying (up to 12 meters below 
sea level) which increases the country’s susceptibility to the impact of rising sea levels.  
 
The Government of Brunei Darussalam recognises the need to protect the environment and 
safeguard the nation’s livelihoods. This is in line with the national vision of Wawasan Brunei 2035. 
The protection of both terrestrial and marine biodiversity is instrumental in supporting the country’s 
efforts on adopting a nature-based solution approach.  
 
2.1 
Observed Climate Trends in Brunei 
 
Brunei Darussalam’s climate trend suggests that there is a rise in mean temperature 
increasing at a rate of 0.25℃ per decade. Rainfall patterns show an intensifying trend in 
the total rainfall amount, increasing at a rate of 100mm per decade. The highest total 
rainfall of 275mm was recorded on 30th September 2019 which broke the previous record 
of 210mm set in 2010. The sum of total rainfall in 2019 was considered normal around 
3,000mm, however there is evident irregularity in terms of the monthly rainfall trend.  
 
Climate change will further aggravate the weather disasters due to the increasing trends 
in extreme high temperature and rainfall, causing prolonged droughts and flash floods. 
The Government of Brunei Darussalam aims to enhance climate science research and 
provide financial support towards bolstering climate resilience. A comparative study in 
Brunei Darussalam identified four key climate change impacts which includes: rising 
temperature; rising sea levels; extreme weather events; and ocean warming and 
acidification.  
 
2.2 
Natural Disasters 
 
Climate change has created a variability in the weather trend which has intensified the 
global water cycle, and the frequency and severity of natural disaster cases. The severity 
of the natural disasters in Brunei Darussalam is compounded by the change in climate 
patterns. Hydrology experts in Brunei Darussalam perceive hydrology-related risks such as 
flood and droughts as the country’s most severe impact from climate change. With a high 
proportion of settlements located along the Brunei Bay in particular, it is expected that the 
area will be under threat from flooding and change in river flow in the next 20 years.  
 
The elevated temperature has resulted in increased incidents of forest and bush fires. With 
the rapid increase of global warming trends, the situation creates hotter and drier 
conditions which aggravate the intensity and severity of heatwaves, resulting in 
devastating fires in Brunei Darussalam’s forests and peat swamps. The damage from the 
fires results in heavy burdens on the government and the community, create challenges 
in the restoration of the ecosystem, flora and fauna, cause damage to properties and 
residential areas, disrupting links while posing threats onto the human and wildlife health 
in the affected vicinities.

2.3 
Health 
 
According to the Ministry of Health, the effects of climate change such as extreme high 
temperatures contribute directly to mortalities from cardiovascular and respiratory related 
diseases, which are particularly significant among the elderly in Brunei Darussalam. The 
rising ozone and other pollutants levels in the air will also exacerbate these underlying 
diseases. Increasing variable rainfall patterns will lead to an increase in the frequency and 
intensity of floods; which can heighten the risk of the water-borne diseases and create 
breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes.  
 
The Aedes mosquitoes vector of dengue is highly sensitive to climate conditions and 
studies suggest that the effects of climate change is likely to continue to increase our 
exposure to dengue. Children and the elderly with pre-existing medical conditions are 
among the most vulnerable to the resulting health risks, which are predicted to be more 
severe as the effects of climate change worsens. Although Brunei Darussalam has been 
declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization since 1987, the risk of regeneration 
of the Anopheles mosquitoes and re-introduction of malaria in Brunei Darussalam may be 
increased as climate conditions change. Dengue fever is also a common type of climate-
sensitive disease. As of April 2019, 45 Dengue cases have been reported in Brunei and 75 
Dengue cases in 2018. 
 
2.4 
Wildlife and Biodiversity 
 
The protection of both terrestrial and marine biodiversity is a priority for the Government 
of Brunei Darussalam. The country is rich in biodiversity and tropical equatorial forest 
resources such as mangroves and sea grasses which are endemic to the island of Borneo.  
 
The changes in the weather patterns will alter the phenology of migration, pollination and 
breeding patterns of our local wildlife and biodiversity. Climate-induced natural disasters 
will potentially cause destruction of wildlife habitat, which may be correlated with the loss 
of key wildlife species population such as the Proboscis Monkey and the Rhinoceros 
Hornbill. Forest fire mostly in the secondary forests and flash flood frequencies in Brunei 
Darussalam could also result in severe deterioration of the environmental quality and their 
habitat.  
 
2.5 
Food Security 
 
The Department of Agriculture and Agrifood, and the Department of Fisheries of the 
Ministry of Primary Resources and Tourism, highlighted that the disasters associated with 
climate change, such as prolonged droughts, flash floods, and ocean warming and 
acidification, will have an adverse impact on the agricultural output and fish stocks in 
Brunei Darussalam. During heavy rainfall seasons, the increased frequency of flooding 
severely damages crops in low-lying land areas while aquaculture farms will be impacted 
by the saltwater intrusions during high storm surges leading to higher fish mortalities.

3.0 
Brunei Darussalam’s Climate Adaptation and Resilience Action  
 
In pursuit of achieving resilience against the impact of climate change, the Government of Brunei 
Darussalam seeks to incorporate a series of climate adaptation strategies which aims to foster 
resilience and adaptation capacity of the nation. 
 
3.1 
BNCCP Strategy 8 on Climate Resilience and Adaptation  
 
The strategy seeks to strengthen Brunei Darussalam’s resilience against climate change 
risks and increase its capacity to adapt to the impacts of the changing climate. This includes, 
among others, enhancing and integrating climate science findings into policies, conducting 
climate impact assessments and consideration of nature-based solutions as an option to 
increase resilience. 
 
3.2 
Current Climate Impacts Mitigation Projects 
 
As part of Brunei Darussalam’s National Development Plan (NDP) projects, the Public 
Works Department through the Department of Drainage and Sewerage of the Ministry of 
Development has implemented a series of flood mitigation works along the coastal area of 
Brunei Darussalam. About a total of 56km coastal protection structures have been 
constructed to protect the country’s coastline against strong waves and erosion with the 
intention to maintain environmental sustainability while achieving socio-economic 
resilience through adequate and well-planned infrastructure and public facilities.  
 
3.3 
Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) 
 
The National Disaster Management Centre organises community-based activities that  aim 
to (i) strengthen institutional capacity and policy frameworks for effective implementation 
for CCA and DRR; (ii) Establish an ASEAN youth leadership in CCA and DRR; (iii) Increase 
replicable programmes and models of building community resilience; and (iv) Strengthen 
awareness-building programmes on a disaster resilient and climate change adaptive 
ASEAN Community. 
 
The programmes are delivered in a form of workshops and forums with the aim to develop 
a disaster-resilient community by increasing education and awareness while nurturing 
public preparedness against climate-induced disasters.  
 
4.0 
Awareness and Education 
 
BNCCP Strategy 10 on Awareness and Education is an important strategy that enables the 
realisation of Brunei Darussalam’s climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. This strategy 
seeks to foster awareness and increase education in matters pertaining to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation efforts in all sectors of society, in line with a Whole-of-Nation 
approach, including the general public, private sectors, Non-Governmental Organisation, 
associations and most importantly, the youth.  
 
5.0 
BNCCP Operational Document  
 
With the launching of the first BNCCP, the Brunei Darussalam Executive Committee on 
Climate Change developed the BNCCP Operational Document Phase I (2021-2025), 
outlining detailed action plans, Key Performance Indicators (KPI), timelines and 
appropriate monitoring mechanism in implementing the ten core national strategies set 
out in the BNCCP.

SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC)

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

(d) 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures 
have been considered in developing the nationally determined 
contribution; 
 
Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented

energy, resources, water resources, coastal resources, human 
settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a 
(d) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris

INTRODUCTION
Comoros' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are negligible in global terms, accounting for around
accounting for around 0.001% of global emissions. However, the Union of the Comoros
wishes to contribute to the international effort to combat global warming by
pursuing its objective of being a carbon sink and promoting sustainable development.
development.  
By ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Union of the Comoros is able to contribute to the international effort to combat global warming.
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Union of the Comoros has reaffirmed its
commitment to limiting its GHG emissions through its first nationally determined
contribution (CDN), submitted in September 2015. This first NDC set
an emissions reduction target of 442 kt CO2eq in 2030 (compared with a baseline scenario).
reference scenario).
The present document constitutes the Union of the Comoros' revised NDC for 2030. It
is the fruit of an inclusive and transparent process, which lasted just over a year, helping to
raise the country's ambition in the fight against climate change, taking into account
the :
-
New orientations in national development policies and strategies, such as the
Plan Comores Emergeant and the strategy for accelerated growth and sustainable development
development strategy,
-
New priorities and costs for priority climate-related investments
climate,
-
Analyses of new sectors and gases to be considered and included in greenhouse
greenhouse gas inventories
At the same time, the country will pursue its socio-economic development in line with the
the Head of State's vision of making Comoros ""an emerging country by 2030, resilient to shocks
resilient to shocks in all dimensions of sustainable development"".
 Gender mainstreaming in the implementation of this new CDN,
reflects the Comorian government's concern to take greater account of the important role that
Comorian women play in a number of sectors heavily impacted by climate change
such as agriculture, water and forest management, health, disaster risk reduction and the specific
disaster risk reduction, as well as the specific impacts they suffer due to their roles and
and responsibilities that differ from those of men in Comorian society.
However, successful implementation of the NDC requires setting up the necessary institutional
institutional arrangements and to work towards success factors in order to address the constraints
constraints.
In view of its limited resources, the actions envisaged to mitigate its greenhouse gas
emissions are nevertheless conditional on obtaining international funding.

1. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
1.1.
Geographical location
Located in the Indian Ocean at the northern entrance to the
Mozambique Channel between the shores of Tanzania
Mozambique and Madagascar (43 and 45.5 degrees
and 45.5 degrees East longitude and -10.5 and -13.5
degrees South latitude), the Comoros archipelago
is made up of 4 volcanic islands (Ngazidja :
1148km2, Mwali: 290km2, Ndzouani: 424km2
and Maoré: 370km2). The distance between them is
30 to 40km apart, and are isolated by underwater
by underwater trenches over 3500m deep.

route of the oil giants that transport 30% of the world's
of the world's oil production from the Middle
Middle East to Europe and America, representing some 5,000 tanker voyages a year.  
1.2.
Population and economy.
Comoros has an estimated population of 832,3221, which varies widely from island to island.
from one island to another. The country is densely populated, with almost 400 inhabitants per km²
concentrated in the main coastal towns. The population is relatively young (56% is
under 20) and is predominantly rural (70%).   
With a gross national income per capita of $1360, the Union of the Comoros has recently joined
the group of lower-middle-income countries, according to the latest
World Bank's 2019 ranking. The primary sector (agriculture, fishing and
livestock breeding) accounts for 46% of GDP, against 12.4% for the secondary sector, and provides 57% of total jobs, of which
jobs, 62.7% of which are held by women, and 90% of operating revenues2.
1.3.
Climate
The Union of the Comoros has a humid tropical climate under oceanic influence.
with two seasons:
▪ A hot, humid southern summer season, running from mid-November to mid
April, with average temperatures of around 27°C at lower altitudes and
maxima between 33 and 35°C and minima around
21° and 24°C
▪ a cool, dry southern winter season from mid-June to mid-October
with an average temperature of 23°C at low altitudes and maxima
between 27 and 29°C.

of the Comoros. Combined with anthropogenic pressures (deforestation, land degradation,
sand extraction, obsolete agricultural practices, etc.) on natural resources,
these hazards are likely to seriously compromise the development efforts undertaken
efforts undertaken by the country in recent years, and accentuate the vulnerability of certain
ecosystems and groups of already fragile populations. Without ambitious measures, the cost of climate
climate-related impacts was estimated in 2014 at 836 million US dollars by 20503,
or an average annual cost over the period of 23 million US dollars, which, in terms of
GDP in 20194 would represent 1.9%.
The vulnerability study carried out in 2018 estimated the losses caused by damage from
0.39% of average GDP over the period 1980 - 2017.
However, this figure is an average over the period considered and does not reflect
the heterogeneity and overall damage caused by the various events, due to
lack of data
Agriculture and biodiversity are the sectors most vulnerable to climate change
followed by forests, coastal zones, fisheries, water resources, health and economic and social
economic and social infrastructure.
Other sources of the country's vulnerability are linked to :  
-
an incidence of poverty4 that varies from island to island, and seems to be higher in rural areas
rural areas,
-
unemployment estimated at 3.7% in 2018, but particularly affecting young people
(8.5%) and women (4.06%),
-
relatively high demographic growth (2.24% in 2018)2 , which, however
lower than GDP growth (3.43% in 2018)3.  
2. ATTENUATION
 
2.1.
Mitigation ambition
Through this revised NDC, the Union of the Comoros expects to achieve a net reduction in GHG emissions
emissions, excluding LULUCF, of 23% and an increase in its net sink of
by 47% by 2030 compared with the reference scenario. The overall cost of this
ambition is estimated at 902 million euros, of which 96 million euros is unconditional, i.e. 5%.

Evolution of emissions and absorptions: business as usual scenario
Business (CNB) scenario
Figure 1: GHG emissions according to the CNA scenario (KtCO2Eq)
The Union of the Comoros presents a net carbon-neutral balance under the CNA scenario,
of around -1,260 ktCO2eq in 2030: the carbon sink offsets all emissions from other
other sectors.  
The sectors that currently emit the most are energy, agriculture and waste treatment.

Without emission mitigation measures, under a business-as-usual scenario, the net
net balance could rise from -1,714 kt CO2eq in 2015 to -1,260 kt CO2eq in 2030.  
2.3.
Projection of GHG emissions with mitigation measures: scenario
CDN SCENARIO,
 
Although the net emissions balance is negative (CNA scenario), the Union des Comores
still has strengths and potential for reducing its GHG emissions over the coming
decade. The graph below illustrates the share of mitigation achieved by reducing
LULUCF emissions compared with a CNA scenario.

The energy sector (energy production and consumption) offers significant potential for
particularly through the use of renewable energies, including photovoltaics and geothermal
photovoltaics and geothermal energy for electricity production, and reducing the use of wood
in the residential and industrial sectors.
Agriculture
Agriculture, a key sector of the Comorian economy, includes livestock breeding
(mainly cattle, goats and poultry), food crops and cash crops
(ylang-ylang, vanilla, etc.). Emissions from this sector come mainly from livestock farming,
via cattle enteric fermentation and manure management.
Given the dynamic growth in production, it is not envisaged that livestock numbers will decrease in the future.

Waste
Waste treatment (mainly food waste) is a major challenge,
as its collection and treatment is still inadequate. Related actions include
improving collection, developing biogas and composting.
Land use, land-use change and forestry
LULUCF is a key sector, accounting for the CO2 absorbed by the growth of trees (forest).

This rise in sea level, combined with coastal erosion, threatens coastal ecosystems
coastal ecosystems, coastal forests, equipment and infrastructure - especially roads - and most
and most coastal communities.  
The results of vulnerability analyses carried out to date in the Comoros show that
that the sectors most vulnerable to climate change are agriculture and biodiversity
biodiversity (very high vulnerability), forestry, coastal zones, fisheries, water resources
health and economic and social infrastructures (high vulnerability). An analysis
of the vulnerability of each of these sectors is presented in the technical report appended to this
this revised NDC.  
Vulnerability is likely to increase in most of these sectors, which require
urgent action to cope with the effects of climate change.  
3.2.
Adaptation strategy
3.2.1. General strategy
Aware of the costs and damage that the impacts of climate change could generate
on various sectors of the country's economy, the Union of the Comoros embarked early on
planning adaptation measures. Adaptation to climate change
integrated into a number of public policy documents and national strategies
both general and sectoral: PANA, National Communications,
policy, strategy and National Action Plan on Climate Change.   
In its revised policy document for the 2018-2021 period, the Stratégie de
Stratégie de Croissance Accélérée et de Développement Durable (SCA2D), the Comorian government
intends to reconcile the structural transformation and diversification of the economy with the
sustainable management of natural resources and resilience, particularly in the agricultural sector
and rural communities, to natural disasters and the effects of climate change.
climate change.
Adaptation is also reflected in the ambition of the newly adopted Plan Comores Emergent 2030 (PCE)
which aims to make Comoros, by 2030: ""a country resilient to shocks in all
resilient to shocks in all dimensions of sustainable development"".  
3.2.2. Revised, realistic objectives to strengthen the country's resilience
The participatory review of the NDC enabled us to update and flesh out the adaptation objectives
adaptation objectives, monitoring indicators and 2030 targets for the sectors identified as the most
most vulnerable to CC in the Comoros (agriculture, biodiversity, forestry, fisheries and
and marine ecosystems, water resources, health and economic and social infrastructure). In
the cross-cutting sectors of disaster risk reduction and the integration of
adaptation and awareness were also prioritized. The table below

4. GENDER APPROACH
4.1.
Context
In addition to other human rights conventions, the Union of the Comoros has ratified the
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)
on October 31, 1994. It adhered to the Beijing Declaration and Platform adopted at the 4th
World Conference on Women in 1995, and was one of the first African countries to ratify, in
2004, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa.
women's rights in Africa.  
In 2008, the country adopted a National Gender Equity and Equality Policy (PNEEG), which aims to
to prioritize greater participation by women in economic development activities, decision-making
in political, traditional and religious decision-making, and in capacity-building for women and girls.
capacity-building for women and girls, the right to education, the right to health, the legal
legal status and enforcement of the fundamental rights of women and girls.  
The vision of the government of the Union of the Comoros is ""to make the Comoros an emerging country
by 2030, respectful of human rights, gender equality and promoting the rule of law"".  
Thus, in 2017, the law on parity instituting a quota of at least 30% of women in elective and nominative
elective and nominative offices was adopted to, among other things, encourage women's political
women's political participation and representation in electoral processes.
 In 2018, article 30 of the revised Constitution guarantees ""the rights of women to be protected
by public authorities against all forms of abandonment, exploitation and violence. Through
article 34, it recognizes ""the right of access to political bodies of local and national representation"" and
national representation"", and article 36 provides for ""a fair and equitable distribution between men and

5. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
The Union of the Comoros aims to consolidate existing mechanisms for collecting, sharing and monitoring data for the evaluation of the implementation of the UNCCD.
for the evaluation of the implementation of the NDC.  
Thus, the National Committee on Climate Change (CNCC) created by ministerial decree n°18-
009 in 2018 will be reviewed in terms of its composition and size, to ensure greater
representativeness of the various sectors and groups that make up Comorian society, all of which are
concerned by the issue of climate change, on the one hand, and better mobilization of its
participants by limiting their number.  Its prerogatives will also be reviewed. The
validation of the feasibility study for setting up a national climate observatory and the
and the mobilization of the human and financial resources required for its operation will complete the
the institutionalization of data collection, harmonization, organization, storage and
data collection, harmonization, organization, storage and easy access.   
In terms of monitoring, the institutional arrangements put in place for the preparation of the first
first biennial report and the third national communication on climate change
for national GHG emission inventories will be strengthened.  
Adaptation measures will be monitored through existing sectoral working groups.
The establishment of a single, institutionalized and centralized monitoring system for the various
technical and political aspects of the NDC is envisaged and should be rapidly supported. The
results of this monitoring will be communicated to the stakeholders involved in implementing the
and decision-makers (at local, sectoral and national level), enabling them to take corrective
corrective adjustment measures.

External financial and technical support
The Union of the Comoros is counting on the international community to consolidate the efforts
over 20 years in the fight against climate change. Indeed, international
international support in the form of financing, capacity-building and technology
technology transfer is needed to support the implementation of the revised NDC:
Financial support
The Union of the Comoros will need an overall envelope of more than 1,301 million EUR9 in order to
implementation of its NDC, i.e. an average annual amount of 130 million
EUR, including at least 902 million EUR for mitigation measures and 399 million
for adaptation measures. Given its very limited resources, the Union of the Comoros
Comoros cannot undertake these measures without the help of the international community, notably
as part of the technological and financial support effort between countries promoted by the Paris Agreement
but also through the Green Climate Fund, funding from multilateral or bilateral partners
or bilateral partners, or other existing or future financing mechanisms, including from the private sector
or from diaspora remittances.  
A large number of the projects included in the Plan Comores Emergent 2030 (PCE) have been
presented at the Conference of Partners for the Development of the Comoros (CPAD 2019)
held in Paris in early December 2019, with the support of France, the World Bank Group
Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Development Bank (AfDB).

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS 
COOK ISLANDS 
Introduction 
The Cook Islands is a small island developing state comprising of 15 small islands with an exclusive economic zone 
(EEZ) of nearly 2 million sq km in the South Pacific Ocean.  Globally, the Cook Islands contributes to only 0.00012% of 
GHG emission, which is an insignificant amount relative to the total global emission of 2004 (IPCC Report, 2007).  
Yet, collectively, the consequences of the global emission via climate change is detrimental to ecosystems, 
infrastructures, economy, and therefore the livelihood of Cook Islanders.    
The Cook Islands has carved a pathway of low carbon development to strengthen climate resilience and further 
reduce its carbon footprint to achieve its national vision, which is ‘to enjoy the highest quality of life consistent with 
the aspirations of our people, and in harmony with our culture and environment'. 
The Cook Islands believes that by aspiring to its national vision it is striving to keep the overall global average 
temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius.  
Mitigation 
Based on the 2006 GHG inventory, the Cook Islands’ emission was estimated at 69,574 t CO2
–e, which contributes to 
0.00012% of the 2004 global GHG emission (IPCC, 2007). 
The energy sector alone contributed 79% of the total emission for 2006, with 34% attributed to electricity generation 
(Figure 1).

The Cook Islands  is committed to a future powered by renewable energy with targets of 50% of islands transformed 
from diesel based to renewable sourced electricity by 2015, to  100% coverage by 2020 (Cook Islands Renewable 
Electricity Chart, 2011).  To date, the Cook Islands has achieved its 50% target and is on track to achieving the 2020   
target.  Using 2006 as the base year, emission from electricity generation will be reduced by 38% by 2020 (Figure 2). 
The Cook Islands has formally submitted a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) under the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for supporting implementation of 100% renewable electricity by 
2020. 
To ensure sustainability and the credibility of its efforts, the Cook Islands will endeavour to put in place the 
appropriate structures to monitor, evaluate and pursue value added activities. These will include inter alia undertake  
the construction of additional and new grid storage, integration of improved energy efficiency and new  
technologies, technology transfer, and strengthening capacities for overall sustainability and co-benefits.  This would 
reduce emissions from electricity generation by a further 43%, totalling an 81% emissions reduction by 2030 (relative 
to 2006). This further reduction is conditional on receiving external support.

of 38% reduction by 2020.  A conditional reduction of 43% by 2030, making a total reduction of 81% in the electricity sub sector.    
Given that the transport sub sector is the second highest GHG emitter in the Cook Islands, the Customs Tariff Act 
2012 establishes noteworthy duty rates on the importation of motor vehicles.  Additionally, the Cook Islands is  
looking to embrace proven  low carbon transport technologies and is currently exploring the most effective 
incentives for promotion of transition towards clean energy transportation.  This will further reduce our overall 
emissions, conditional on external support. 
Adaptation  
Unconditional 
Given the Cook Islands size, vulnerabilities, limited resources, and capacities whilst noting also its special 
circumstances, designating its entire EEZ of almost two million sq km as a marine park is evidence of national 
commitment to the global effort to building the resilience of marine ecosystems.  
The country has developed key plans and policies that articulate its priorities to reduce vulnerability and strengthen 
resilience. This includes the first 20 year national vision 'Te Kaveinga Nui', accompanied by the first National 
Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) 2007-2010, and subsequently the second NSDP 2011-2015 with the latest 
2015-2020 to follow.  The Joint National Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation Plan (JNAP) is a 
five-year (2011–2015) roadmap that is currently being updated to 2020. The Climate and Disaster Compatible 
Development Policy 2013-2016, provide direction for more coordinated adaptation and mitigation actions within 
and across all sectors. The Renewable Energy Chart provides the pathway of transforming the electricity sector from 
diesel based to renewable energy sources. 
The Cook Islands is confident that its existing frameworks and robust systems guiding ongoing climate change 
mitigation and adaptation measures are considerable, and its commitments are ambitious to the global goal despite 
its unique circumstances. 
Conditional 
Note that Loss and Damage is not factored into the policy and planning processes outlined above. Nor are the full 
costs associated with building resilience to climate change, which the Cook Islands expects will be covered by the 
international community over time. 
The Cook Islands is confident that its strategies and policies pre 2020 and post 2020 will reduce and offset its carbon 
emissions and strengthen resilience. These actions include inter alia coastal protection, water security, agriculture, 
forestry, marine conservation, waste, tourism and land management.  
The Cook Islands is confident that it can deliver 100 per cent of its adaptation measures, provide tools and 
technologies and strengthen capacities in all its inhabited islands, conditional to external support.   
Cook Islands reserves the right to adjust this target and its parameters subject to the outcome of COP21 and to 
external support. 
A fair and ambitious contribution under the Convention 
Cook Islands intended nationally determined contribution is fair, ambitious and responsible given its special 
circumstances and considering that its total global GHG emission is negligible.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international

Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

Scope and coverage: 
 
(a) 
General description of the target; 
The target is an economy-wide legally binding target of a net domestic reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% compared to 1990 by 2030, without 
contribution from international credits. 
Geographical scope: EU and its Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, 
Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, 
Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Austria, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden)2 
 
This section considers the following legislation to deliver the enhanced 
target: Directive (EU) 2023/959 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a system for 
greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union, Regulation 
(EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council as amended 
by Regulation (EU) 2023/857 (ESR Regulation), Regulation (EU) 
2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council (LULUCF 
Regulation) as amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (LULUCF 
Regulation). Additional legislation and mitigation measures, at EU level 
and in Member States, contribute to the reductions needed to meet this

Information on the planning processes that the Party undertook to 
prepare its nationally determined contribution and, if available, on the 
Party’s implementation plans, including, as appropriate: 
 
Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and 
engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a 
gender-responsive 
manner; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The content of the EU NDC has been based on an extensive impact 
assessment3, as well as stakeholder input, collected via public consultation4. 
 
The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender 
equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: 
the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

(b) 
Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France 
47,5%, Croatia 16,7%, Italy 43,7%, Cyprus 32%, Latvia 17%,

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows: 
Belgium -320Kt CO2eq, Bulgaria -1163kt CO2eq, Czechia -827kt

(c) 
How the Party’s preparation of its nationally determined 
contribution has 
been informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement; 
The EU shall set its climate target in accordance with the European Climate 
Law. To that end, at the latest within 6 months of the first Global Stocktake, 
the Commission shall make a legislative proposal, as appropriate, on a Union-
wide climate target for 2040 based on a detailed impact assessment, as per 
article 4.3 of the European Climate Law REGULATION (EU) 2021/1119 OF 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 
30 June 2021.

(i) 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures 
have been considered in developing the nationally determined 
contribution; 
 
Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented 
to contribute to mitigation co-benefits, including information 
on adaptation plans that also yield mitigation co-benefits, 
which may cover, but are not limited to, key sectors, such as 
energy, resources, water resources, coastal resources, human 
settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Regulation (EU) 2021/1119 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 2021 
establishing the framework for achieving climate neutrality and amending Regulations (EC) 
No 401/2009 and (EU) 2018/1999 (‘European Climate Law’)

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies. 
(c) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris 
Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a 
(d) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris 
Agreement 
The EU complies with this provision by having an economy-wide absolute

achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2; 
 
How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards

Agreement. 
The EU considers its NDC to be in line with the objective of the 
UNFCCC and long-term goal of the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, as 
explained in 6a  and 6b.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change.

the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows:

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the Republic of Djibouti is an extension of 
the country’s commitments to fighting the effects of climate change. The process of drafting the INDC 
enabled a summary of all of the policies and programmes linked to climate change. It also provided an 
opportunity to reassess financing needs to fund the country’s adaptation.  
As an LDC and a coastal country of the Horn of Africa, the country’s vulnerability is considerably high. 
As a result, this contribution reflects both the country’s political will to participate in the worldwide 
reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and the scope of its adaptation needs. 
The Republic of Djibouti has committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 40% by the year 2030, 
representing close to 2 Mt of CO2e, compared to projections for that year according to the business-
as-usual scenario. This commitment is an ambitious one for a country like the Republic of Djibouti. It 
can be attained through a combination of mitigation measures and the development of sustainable 
economic sectors like renewable energies.  
To fulfil that level of ambition, the Republic of Djibouti will need to invest more than US $3.8 billion, in 
collaboration with the international community. An additional US $1.6 billion, conditional on new 
funding sources like the Green Climate Fund, along with international support, would enable the 
country to reduce its emissions by a further 20% by 2030. The total effort, under both the unconditional 
and conditional scenarios, would essentially entail maintaining the country’s emissions at roughly their 
level in 2010. 
In terms of adaptation, the Republic of Djibouti has undertaken numerous plans and programmes. The 
priority objectives are also linked to the country’s social priorities: 
 
Reduction of vulnerability to drought; 
 
Protection against rising sea levels; 
 
Improvement of access to water; 
 
Protection of biodiversity; 
 
Reinforcement of the resilience of rural populations. 
The adaptation projects currently being implemented account for a budget of nearly €100 million. 
However, that sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation 
under the 2°C Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario. 
These figures show that investing in adaptation measures is a crucial issue for the Republic of 
Djibouti. The country will not be able to raise the necessary funds on its own. With this contribution, 
the Republic of Djibouti wants to reaffirm its belief in the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities and to call on the international community to mobilise in response to this decisive issue 
for all of humanity.

NATIONAL CONTEXT 
The Republic of Djibouti is located in the Horn of Africa, at the intersection of the Gulf of Aden and the 
Red Sea. The country has a semi-desert tropical climate characterised by recurring natural 
catastrophes and extended periods of drought. Its arable land, natural and mineral resources, and 
water resources are very low and are subject to strong pressure from climate change. With an 
estimated per capita gross national product (GNP) of US $1,030 in 2014, the Republic of Djibouti is 
one of the poorest countries in the world, and one of the most vulnerable to climate change. 
At COP19 in Warsaw, the Republic of Djibouti underscored the fact that climate change is a threat to 
the country’s food security and water resources, as well as to sustainable development. With its arid 
climate and low level of social development, the Republic of Djibouti is vulnerable to various climate-
related effects, including extreme drought, extreme temperatures, rising sea levels, flash floods and 
the salinization of soils and water. These phenomena have already been observed in the country and 
are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in the future, according to the various climate 
scenarios.  
In the case of an optimistic climate scenario, the cost of the damage is likely to exceed US $5 billion. 
Implementing adaptation measures would make it possible to anticipate the effects of climate change. 
An investment of close to US $1 billion would enable a reduction of the total costs of the impact by 
two, account taken of residual damage.

The Republic of Djibouti has thus adopted a proactive position to handling climate change. It ratified 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995. Pursuant to the 
provisions of Article 4 of that convention, the country developed a second national communication, 
which it submitted to the UNFCCC in 2014. Earlier, in 2006, the country had already identified a 
number of priority adaptation and resilience actions as part of a National Adaptation Programme of 
Action encompassing activities in the agricultural, forestry, water, livestock and coastal sectors. 
To combine the country’s fight against the effects of climate change with its economic development, 
the Republic of Djibouti is pursuing the objective of becoming a veritable economic crossroads and a 
showcase for sustainable development along the Red Sea. To achieve that aim, several political plans 
are under development, including national strategies for a green economy, for biodiversity and on 
climate change.  
The Republic of Djibouti will work to contribute to global efforts to reduce GHG emissions. This 
ambition will rely on the development of renewable energies such as geothermal, wind and solar 
power. But the country will need to focus its efforts on adaptation above all and seek out the support of 
the international community. The present contribution is part of a dynamic process and may be 
reassessed in line with changes in the national and international contexts.

DJIBOUTI’S CONTRIBUTION TO MITIGATION 
Objective and expected directions for 2030 
General objectives 
By means of unconditional measures, the Republic of Djibouti is committed to preventing 1.8 Mt CO2e 
of future GHG emissions, thus reducing its emissions by 40% compared to the business-as-usual 
scenario.  
The implementation of conditional measures would enable a further reduction in CO2e emissions by 
0.9 Mt, or 20% of GHG emissions compared to the business-as-usual scenario for 2030. In this way, 
the conditional mitigation scenario would enable the Republic of Djibouti to maintain its volume of 
emissions at a level equivalent to that of 2010. 
Business-as-usual scenario 
The linear sectoral projection was used to estimate the GHG emissions level in 2030 without the 
implementation of any mitigation measures. In that case, 2030 GHG emissions would more than 
double their level in 2010. Nearly 55% of those emissions come from the “Energy” category, making it 
a priority sector for the implementation of mitigation options by the Republic of Djibouti.

Assumptions and methodological approaches 
Model and methodology for estimating emissions 
The business-as-usual scenario was developed using the GACMO model and on linear sectoral 
projections. It is based on the 2000 inventory of GHG emissions, produced in accordance with the 
1996 revised guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
Gases covered 
The contribution of the Republic of Djibouti is based on estimated carbon dioxide (CO2), methane 
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions across all economic sectors. Fluoride gas emissions were not 
counted, because they were deemed negligible at the national level. 
Geographic and sectoral scope 
The selected sectors were defined on the basis of the latest GHG inventory, as per the Revised 1996 
IPCC Guidelines, and cover the entire country. In view of the uncertainty in respect of the level of 
carbon sequestration by forest land and of emissions in uncultivated areas, the “Land Use” category 
was not selected.  
List of selected categories and sub-categories:  
Energy  
 
 
Electricity imports 
 
Consumption of fossil fuels by the industrial, residential, 
commercial, agricultural and transport sectors. 
Agriculture  
 
 
Enteric fermentation 
 
Manure management 
 
Agricultural soils 
Waste 
 
Solid waste 
Industrial Processes 
 
Cement production

Baseline year and data  
2000 was taken as the baseline year. As a result, any mitigation measures implemented after that date 
are not included in the business-as-usual scenarios. 
The data were extracted from the latest national GHG inventory, published in 2014. Data for the 
“Energy” category were enhanced with more precise information collected by the Agence Djiboutienne 
pour la maîtrise de l’énergie (ADME) [Djibouti Energy Management Agency]. 
The GWP values used were those identified by the IPCC for the preparation of national emissions 
inventories in accordance with UNFCCC Decision 17/CP.8. 
Strategy and planning  
General strategy and evolution of the legislative and regulatory framework 
The Republic of Djibouti is preparing to launch its green economy strategy, the aims of which are to 
encourage the use of low carbon technologies that are resilient to climate change, to promote green 
jobs, and to take advantage of climate finance to raise funds nationally and internationally. This 
strategy will be developed for the economy’s key sectors, in line with the long-term vision for the 
country.  
In parallel, the Republic of Djibouti is in the process of developing a national strategy on climate 
change. That strategy will draw on both the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and the National 
Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), adopted in 2006. It will incorporate changes in regulations 
relating to buildings, air conditioners and refrigerators.  
These two complementary strategies should enable the Republic of Djibouti to attain its 2030 targets 
as set out herein.

Equity and ambition of the contribution of the Republic of Djibouti 
On a global scale, the IPCC calculated the quantity of GHGs as more than 49,000 Mt of CO2e in 2004. 
As a result, the annual emissions produced by the Republic of Djibouti, estimated at close to 2 Mt 
CO2e in 2010, represent less than 0.005% of the global volume. In other words, its emissions are non-
significant compared with worldwide emissions. Nonetheless, the Republic of Djibouti has prepared 
this contribution to reaffirm its belief in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and to 
take unprecedented measures in response to this issue. 
As an LDC, it is vital for the Republic of Djibouti to reduce its emissions without significantly affecting 
the country’s economic and social development. This contribution guarantees an equitable 
commitment. In the case of the unconditional scenario, the level of GHG per GDP point will decrease 
from 2.5 in 2000 to 0.8 in 2030. In addition, the planned mitigation measures will support priority 
economic sectors like renewable energies and energy efficiency. On its own scale, the Republic of 
Djibouti is making significant contributions to reducing global emissions.  
The planned unconditional level of emissions reductions, planned under the unconditional scenario, is 
40% compared to the business-as-usual scenario for 2030. This ambitious commitment will support 
other country’s commitments so as to make a collective contribution to the global objective of limiting 
the global temperature rise to 2°C. For the Republic of Djibouti, upholding this objective will be 
essential, given the country’s heavy exposure to the impact of climate change. Adaptation and 
increased resilience will remain the priority for the country.

DJIBOUTI’S CONTRIBUTION TO ADAPTATION 
Objectives, national priorities and long-term vision 
In recent years, climate change has already appeared in the form of increases in average global 
temperature and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events like drought and flooding of 
oueds. For example, the minimum temperature recorded in Djibouti City has risen by close to 1.3°C in 
the space of 30 years. In addition, the geographical location of the Republic of Djibouti makes it 
directly vulnerable to the rising sea level, especially given that 88% of its population lives along the 
coastline. 
These difficult conditions cause serious problems in terms of the availability of a sufficient quantity and 
quality of water resources, be it for the country’s human population, livestock or agriculture. The 
aquifer’s resources are no longer enough to meet the country’s multiple needs.  
The Republic of Djibouti also boasts relatively significant land-based biodiversity (mangroves, Day 
Forest and endemic species). However, it is stricken by the ongoing shrinkage of its arable land and 
its biodiversity due to rapid desertification, which will only be exacerbated with rising temperatures. 
Likewise, in respect of marine ecosystems, more than half the coral cover is likely to disappear in the 
years to come.  
This deterioration could have a profound effect on the local populations that are dependent on those 
resources and who already live in poverty. The various impacts of climate change engender major 
financial and human losses, primarily in the nation’s capital but also in the rest of the country. As a 
result, national adaptation priorities have been defined for 2035, broken down into multiple strategies. 
Concerning adaptation, this will entail:  
 
Reducing vulnerability to drought; 
 
Protecting against rising sea levels; 
 
Improving access to water; 
 
Protecting biodiversity; 
 
Reinforcing the resilience of rural populations.

Funding: UNEP. 
Support project for the 
resilience of rural 
populations 
The funds allocated under the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) 
will target the following sectors:  
(a) Water and sanitation; 
(b) Food security.  
The actions planned for those two sectors will aim for the equitable 
development of the country’s rural and underprivileged areas, with an 
emphasis on strengthening the resilience of vulnerable populations. 
The proposed actions will be subject to climate change impact reduction 
requirements, dictated by strict environmental criteria. As the country 
contains a number of already weakened ecosystems, any work done to 
improve food security and water resources management will need to 
endeavour to preserve the environment from a perspective of 
sustainable development. 
Funding: European Development Fund.

desalination plant 
 
population’s drinking water needs, which totalled some 593 million m3 in 
2011. As a result, the rapid launch of the construction of a second 
desalination plant could be envisaged. 
Repairs to water mains 
 
Water loss within the water supply network is estimated at more than 
30%. This is a considerable loss, further aggravating water shortages. 
Bringing the mains up to standard therefore appears to be a vital step. 
Such an investment has not yet been costed, however. 
Construction of new 
dykes 
 
The safety of the coastal zone is crucial to Djibouti’s development. Faced 
with rising sea levels, many cities that are vulnerable to this threat, such 
as New York and the majority of Dutch cities, have already prepared 
dyke construction investment plans. This solution has not yet been 
studied for Djibouti, but it could certainly be considered. For informational 
purposes, the plans launched by the Netherlands amount to a total of 
more than €20 billion, for exposure similar to that of Djibouti. 
Construction project for 
a dam in the Ambouli 
watershed 
Djibouti City, the national capital, is regularly threatened by devastating 
floods from the Ambouli watershed, with the loss of human life and 
serious material and economic damage. 
The construction of a dam in that watershed could considerably reduce 
the effects of flooding and could also serve to restock the groundwater 
that supplies the capital.

IMPLEMENTATION METHODS  
Capacity-building 
Given the weakness of its economic and financial capacities and the scale of its funding needs for 
poverty reduction, environmental management and sustainable development, Djibouti is one of the 
potential beneficiaries of this initiative. To be able to seize that opportunity, the country set itself the 
objective of developing a National Strategy for a Green Economy, which will enable it to better 
incorporate climate finance into its development, as well as a national strategy for preserving 
biodiversity and another on climate change in order to boost its resilience in respect of the harmful 
effects of climate change, whilst contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
Need for technology transfers 
The majority of the options presented above, such as the construction of a geothermal, wind or 
photovoltaic power plant, will necessitate major technological transfers. It is therefore crucial for the 
Republic of Djibouti to establish long-term partnerships with university centres or private companies 
capable of supplying those technologies. At present, an important partnership with the German 
Cooperation is providing Djibouti with technical and financial support for the promotion of renewable 
energies. 
Funding needs 
In a 6% growth scenario, the investment required to maintain an emissions level similar to that of 2010 
(conditional scenario) is more than US $5.5 billion. The unconditional scenario, which is already 
financed, either by means of the national budget or through the support of the international 
community, represents approximately 70% of that amount.  
For the measures forming the conditional scenario, whose cost is estimated at US $1.65 billion, it has 
yet to be determined the proportion of that investment that could be covered domestically. The 
national strategy for energy procurement and management, currently under development, should 
provide better visibility on this point. Nonetheless, considering the level of investment required, it is 
very likely that Djibouti will need to access international funding to cover a large proportion of that 
investment. 
The adaptation projects currently being implemented account for a budget of nearly €100 million. That 
sum represents just 12% of the total amount that will need to be invested in adaptation under the 2°C 
Scenario, and a mere 7.5% in the case of the 4°C Scenario. 
These figures show that investing in adaptation measures is a crucial issue for the Republic of 
Djibouti. The country will not be able to raise the necessary funds on its own. As a result, the 
mobilization of the international community will be vital. 
Details of the implementation methods are provided in a dedicated document entitled “Guide de mise 
en œuvre pour la Contribution Prévue Déterminée Nationale” (“Implementation Guide for the Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution”).

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows:

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Fiji’s Updated Nationally Determined Contribution 
Introduction  
 
The Fijian Government is committed to the full, effective and transparent 
implementation of the Paris Agreement in accordance with its provisions 
and the relevant Decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Na-
tions Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) and the Conference 
of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement 
(CMA).  
 
Fiji hereby communicates to the UNFCCC: 
   
An update to its existing Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pursu-
ant to Article 4.11 of the Paris Agreement that includes:  
 a reaffirmation of its 2030 target; 
 a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; 
 up-front information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding; 
 a commitment to enact its Climate Change Bill by 2021; and 
 a commitment to operationalise its National Adaptation Plan.

paragraph 
1(b) 
above is not applicable, 
Parties to provide other 
relevant information 
 
Fiji will undertake a range of actions concerning the 
sectors not covered by its quantitative commitments. 
These include the following: 
 
Long Term Decarbonisation Plans and mobilisation 
of Climate Finance 
 
In the Low Emission Development Strategy (LEDS) 
(2018-2050),1 which is an economy-wide decarbonisa-
tion plan, Fiji has identified mitigation options for major 
sectors of the economy and has assessed the costs of 
these mitigation actions to inform sectoral plans and 
future NDCs. Fiji will operationalise its decarbonisation 
ambitions by implementing its NDC Investment Plan 
that is targeted towards creating a strong business case 
for mobilising new and additional climate finance.   
 
Creating an Enabling Environment for Decarbonisa-
tion Ambitions 
 
                                                      
1 Fiji Low Emission Development Strategy 2018-2050 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-3- 
Consistent with the LEDS priorities, several important 
ongoing projects in the Agriculture, Waste and Forestry 
sectors are contributing to GHG emissions reductions, 
carbon sequestration, and enhanced climate resilience. 
Over the period of this NDC, Fiji will work on creating 
an enabling environment for sectorial decarbonisation 
and reporting initiatives through the enactment and op-
erationalization of its Climate Change Bill in 2021.  
 
Catalysing Sustainable Production and Consumption 
for holistic climate action 
 
Fiji has introduced a single-use plastic ban from 1 Janu-
ary 2020 that entails a ban on the importation, manufac-
ture, distribution and use of single-use plastic bags. 
Commencing from 1 January 2021, Fiji will also impose 
a ban on the importation and export of Polystyrene 
products. From 1 August 2021, this will also entail a ban 
on the manufacture, distribution and use of polystyrene. 
This is being enacted through the Environment Man-
agement Act (2005).2 
 
d) Target relative to the 
reference indicator, ex-
pressed numerically, for 
example in percentage or 
amount of reduction 
30% of BAU CO2 emissions from the energy sector by 
2030. Absolute reduction as compared to reference year 
emissions.  
 
Of the 30% reduction of BAU baseline CO2 emissions, 
10% will be achieved “unconditionally” using available 
resources in the country and 20% achieved “conditional-
ly”.  
 
e) Information on sources of 
data used in quantifying 
the reference point(s) 
Baseline data was compiled and provided by the Fiji 
Revenue and Customs Services, Fiji Bureau of Statistics 
and Energy Fiji Limited.    
f) Information on the cir-
cumstances under which 
the Party may update the 
values of the reference 
indicators. 
Fiji may update the reference indicator to account for 
improvement in data collection in the Biennial Update 
Report 2022.

b) Whether it is a single-
year or multi-year target, 
as applicable.  
Single- year target  
3. Scope and Coverage  
a) General description of 
the target;  
Fiji’s 2015 NDC has the following mitigation targets:  
Target 1: To reduce 30% of BAU CO2 emissions from 
the energy sector by 2030. 
 
Target 2: As a contribution to Target 1, to reach close to 
100% renewable energy power generation (grid-
connected) by 2030, thus reducing an expected 20% of 
energy sector CO2 emissions under a BAU scenario. 
 
Target 3: As a contribution to Target 1, to reduce ener-
gy sector CO2 emissions by 10% through energy effi-
ciency improvements economy-wide, implicitly in the 
transport, industry, and electricity demand-side sub-
sectors. 
 
In this update, Fiji also commits to: 
 
Target 4: As a contribution to Target 1, to reduce do-
mestic maritime shipping emissions by 40%.  
 
Adaptation Target  
Target 5: To adopt Climate Smart Agriculture practices, 
with emphasis on the promotion of sustainable practices 
in crop management, livestock and sugarcane farming 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-5- 
and fisheries.  
 
Target 6: To enhance resilience by upgrading, repairing 
and relocating existing critical public infrastructure.  
 
Target 7: Develop simplified and standardised early 
warning and monitoring systems, and prioritise nature-
based solutions to mitigate the impact of flooding and 
cyclones. 
 
Target 8: Relocate highly vulnerable communities, and 
implement the concept of ‘build back better’.  
 
Target 9: Build strong healthcare system by implement-
ing the ‘Guidelines for climate-resilient and environ-
mentally sustainable health care facilities in Fiji’. 
   
Target 10: To conserve natural environment and biodi-
versity wealth enabling sustainable long-term provision 
of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration 
potential. 
 
Target 11: To plant 30 million trees by 2035. 
 
Target 12: To establish 30% of our Exclusive Economic 
Zones (EEZ) as Marine Protected Areas and work to-
wards 100% management of our EEZ by 2030 through 
the implementation of the National Ocean Policy.   
 
b) Sectors, gases, categories 
and pools covered by the 
nationally 
determined 
contribution, 
including, 
as applicable, consistent 
with IPCC guidelines;  
Fiji’s NDC is specific to the energy sector in terms of a 
GHG (greenhouse gas) baseline due to it being the sin-
gle-largest emissions source in 2013 (reference year). 
 
The mitigation actions identified within the energy sec-
tor are split between the following sub-sectors as articu-
lated in Fiji’s NDC Implementation Roadmap: 
• Electricity Generation and Transmission 
• Demand-Side Energy Efficiency 
• Transport (Land and Maritime) 
 
In this update, Fiji also increases its scope to include the 
Oceans sector recognising it as a significant carbon sink.  
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-6- 
 
Greenhouse gases covered are: Carbon dioxide 
(CO2), Nitrous oxide (N2O) and Methane (CH4).  
 
c) How the Party has taken 
into consideration para-
graphs 31(c) and (d) of 
decision 1/CP.21;  
While Fiji has conducted a detailed assessment of the 
mitigation options for all its sectors in the LEDS, it is 
noted that the data needed to rigorously assess the im-
pact of policies and actions on emissions in other sectors 
is not available and must be developed over time.  
 
Furthermore, the current scope of the NDC is pertinent 
on the scarce capacity to assess and monitor economy-
wide emissions. This is in part due to the methodological 
clarifications, including data uncertainty and availability 
and lack of relevant monitoring, reporting and verifica-
tions systems.  In light of Fiji’s national circumstances, 
data collection, modelling, coordination processes and 
building capacities are long-term tasks that must take 
place over an extended period with the support of na-
tional, regional and international partners.  
 
d) Mitigation 
co-benefits 
resulting from Parties’ 
adaptation actions and/or 
economic diversification 
plans, including descrip-
tion of specific projects, 
measures and initiatives 
of Parties’ adaptation ac-
tions and/or economic 
diversification plans.  
Fiji sees this NDC update as an opportunity to further 
support its commitment towards the Paris Agreement by 
mainstreaming its blue economy ambitions in to its NDC 
targets through enhanced ocean governance to not only 
achieve national ocean conservation but also contribute 
towards enhancing the ocean as a carbon sink. As such, 
Fiji through its National Ocean Policy, will be allocating 
30% of its EEZ as Marine Protected Areas and work 
towards 100% management of its EEZ by 2030. This 
compliments Fiji’s National Adaptation Plan3 concur-
rently its Low Emission Development Strategy, which 
highlights the need to sustainably manage and protect 
marine and coastal ecosystems, strengthen their resili-
ence, and restore them when they are degraded. This 
includes conserving ocean reservoirs as carbon sinks 
through supporting the restoration, enhancement and 
conservation of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, 
sea grasses and coral reefs.

4. Planning Process 
a) Information on the planning processes that the Party undertook to prepare its NDC 
and, if available, on the Party’s implementation plans, including, as appropriate:  
i. Domestic 
institutional 
arrangements, public par-
ticipation 
and 
engage-
ment with local commu-
nities 
and 
indigenous 
peoples, in a gender-
responsive manner;  
The Climate Change and International Cooperation Di-
vision (CCICD) of the Ministry of Economy is the re-
sponsible national agency for addressing climate change 
policy issues in Fiji. The CCICD is guided by the Na-
tional Climate Change Policy (NCCP)4 and works in 
collaboration 
with 
government 
agencies, 
non-
governmental organizations, regional and international 
agencies and development partners. CCICD is responsi-
ble for preparing national reports to the UNFCCC in 
cooperation with other national stakeholders. It was also 
the lead agency for preparing and submitting the initial 
NDC under the Paris Agreement.  
 
The Low Emission Development Strategy Steering 
Committee is a coordination mechanism established for 
the development of Fiji’s Low Emissions Development 
Strategy. It comprises of Senior Government Officials 
from relevant Ministries and Public Utilities. The Com-
mittee was convened to validate this NDC Update and is 
envisaged to be an established body under Fiji’s Climate 
Change Bill to oversee the NDC revision process as part 
of the institutional arrangement for current and future 
NDCs.  
 
This NDC Update was prepared by taking into account 
Fiji’s national circumstances, challenges and opportuni-
ties for mitigation. In the planning phase from 2015 to 
2020, Fiji has developed its NDC Implementation 
Roadmap, the Low Emission Development Strategy and 
the National Adaptation Plan through inclusive stake-

holder consultations and is now in the process of finalis-
ing the NDC Investment Plan and Projects Pipeline, 
Fiji’s Technology Needs Assessment, SDG7 Roadmap 
and the review of the Fiji Energy Policy in collaboration 
and consultation with industry stakeholders, academic 
experts, local NGO groups, and technical consultants. 
These key stakeholders provide additional inputs on 
available and future technologies for long term mitiga-
tion and adaptation actions in Fiji.   
 
Gender considerations: The NDC planning process was 
guided by the principle of gender-responsiveness as 
articulated in the National Climate Change Policy. The 
Policy emphasises and makes a specific call to ensure 
that all approaches and methods for adaptation and miti-
gation are guided by the consideration of gender issues, 
support improved gender-balance in both the decision-
making processes and related implementation arrange-
ments, promote gender-equitable benefits, and achieve 
outcomes which ensure that gender is a key considera-
tion when programming finance and capacity-building. 
 
ii. Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate:  
a) National circumstances, 
such as geography, cli-
mate, economy, sustaina-
ble 
development 
and 
poverty eradication;  
Fiji is a tropical island country located in the Oceania in 
the South Pacific Ocean and comprises of 332 islands 
scattered across roughly 1.3 million km2 of ocean that is 
declared as its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Among 
its vast archipelago, Viti Levu (10,429 km2) and Vanua 
Levu (5,556 km2) are the two largest islands and major 
inhabited regions, comprising of 87% of the land area 
(18,333 km2). The total estimated population as per the 
2017 National Census is 884,887 of which 55.9% reside 
in urban areas and 44.1% in rural areas. These islands 
are volcanic in nature and are mostly dominated by steep 
mountainous terrains. Fiji is located between 15 and 22 
South latitude and 175 East and 178 West longitudes 
and thus experiences an oceanic tropical climate where 
the daily average temperature is constant at about 25 
degrees Celsius. The country has an estimated GDP of 
US$5.5 billion, with US$5,800 per capita GDP wherein 
tourism is the most important sector and accounts for 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-9- 
more than 25% of the GDP.  
  
The country has faced adverse climate impacts, such as 
stronger storms, rising seas, and changing weather pat-
terns. Fiji was struck by the Southern Hemisphere’s 
strongest-ever storm, Cyclone Winston, in 2016, which 
resulted in estimated damages amounting to US$0.9 
billion, including US$0.6 billion in damage and US$0.3 
billion in losses representing one third of the total GDP 
(Republic of Fiji, 2020). Due to the COVID-19 crisis, 
Fiji’s economy is expected to shrink by approximately 
20% in 2020, with the tourism sector facing the full 
brunt of the pandemic-induced travel restrictions. As a 
result, around 118,500 people are jobless.  
 
b) Best practices and expe-
rience 
related 
to 
the 
preparation of the nation-
ally determined contribu-
tion;  
Fiji has built wealth of knowledge and experience in 
developing new strategies in climate change adaptation 
and mitigation. The NDC Implementation Roadmap, 
National Adaptation Plan, Low Emission Development 
Strategy, Displacement Guidelines, Planned Relocation 
Guidelines, Climate Vulnerability Assessment and the 
revised Climate Change Policy 2018-2030 help main-
stream and build momentum for the operationalization 
of Fiji’s NDC commitment nationally, as well as estab-
lish a knowledge base and institutional coordination for 
the NDC planning process. Furthermore, these processes 
have helped strengthen the evidence base by building 
political and public support for climate action nationally 
and enhancing the credibility of Fiji’s strong climate 
leadership internationally.   
 
c) Other contextual aspira-
tions 
and 
priorities 
acknowledged when join-
ing the Paris Agreement;  
Fiji is committed to reduce GHG emissions and recog-
nises that this will require significant capacity building, 
technology transfer and finance.  
 
Fiji has made steady progress in putting in place appro-
priate strategies for meeting its adaptation needs and 
mitigation ambitions, however significant challenges 
remain in mobilising the resources necessary to imple-
ment its planned adaptation and mitigation measures. As 
a small island developing state, Fiji has limited financial 
resources for climate actions, a situation exacerbated by 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-10- 
the significant economic losses Fiji incurs through sud-
den onsets of climate change such as cyclones and storm 
surges. Hence the scale of investments needed for neces-
sary adaptation and mitigation measures outpaces Fiji’s 
current ability to finance the transformational change 
envisioned for a sustainable, inclusive, resilient and low 
carbon economy.  
 
d) Specific 
information 
applicable to Parties, in-
cluding regional econom-
ic integration organiza-
tions and their member 
States, that have reached 
an agreement to act joint-
ly under Article 4, para-
graph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the 
Parties that agreed to act 
jointly and the terms of 
the agreement, in accord-
ance with Article 4, para-
graphs 16–18, of the Par-
is Agreement;  
N/A  
e) How the Party’s prepara-
tion of its NDC has been 
informed by the out-
comes 
of 
the 
global 
stocktake, in accordance 
with Article 4, paragraph 
9, of the Paris Agree-
ment;  
As the President of COP23, Fiji led and championed the 
Talanoa Dialogue in COP23 and COP24, which generat-
ed political momentum for enhanced climate action, 
including calling for Parties to the Paris Agreement to 
update their NDCs. The preparation of Fiji’s enhanced 
NDC was informed by the recommendations of the Ta-
lanoa Call for Action, taking into account Fiji’s national 
circumstances. 
 
The collaborative approach of the Talanoa Dialogue was 
adopted to develop this NDC Update by building on the 
guiding questions of where are we?, where do we want 
to go? and how do we get there?.  This experience is 
valuable and would provide guidance for processes to-
wards the global stocktake scheduled for 2023.

f) Each Party with an NDC under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of ad-
aptation action and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris Agreement to submit in-
formation on:  
i. How the economic and 
social consequences of 
response measures have 
been considered in de-
veloping the NDC;  
Fiji has considered all social, economic, and environ-
mental impacts of its domestic mitigation measures 
through the development processes of its NDC Imple-
mentation Roadmap, the Low Emission Development 
Strategy, and the National Adaptation Plan. These as-
pects have also been taken into consideration in the de-
velopment of the NDC Investment Plan and Project 
Pipelines. 
  
ii. Specific 
projects, 
measures and activities to 
be implemented to con-
tribute to mitigation co-
benefits, including in-
formation on adaptation 
plans that also yield miti-
gation co-benefits, which 
may cover, but are not 
limited to, key sectors, 
such 
as 
energy, 
re-
sources, water resources, 
coastal resources, human 
settlements 
and 
urban 
planning, agriculture and 
forestry; and economic 
diversification 
actions, 
which may cover, but are 
not limited to, sectors 
such as manufacturing 
and industry, energy and 
mining, 
transport 
and 
communication, 
con-
struction, tourism, real 
estate, agriculture and 
fisheries.

5. Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, re-
movals: 
a) Assumptions and meth-
odological 
approaches 
used for accounting for 
anthropogenic 
green-
house gas emissions and 
removals corresponding 
to the Party’s nationally 
determined contribution, 
consistent with decision 
1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance 
adopted by the CMA;  
 
Fiji will account for its anthropogenic GHG emissions 
and removals using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories. 
b) Assumptions and meth-
odological 
approaches 
used for accounting for 
the implementation of 
policies and measures or 
strategies in the national-
ly determined contribu-
tion;  
 
Fiji will apply specific assumptions and methodologies, 
where relevant, when reporting on various policies and 
measures in its Biennial Update Report or Biennial 
Transparency Report.  
c) If applicable, information 
on how the Party will 
take into account existing 
methods and guidance 
under the Convention to 
account for anthropogen-
ic emissions and remov-
als, in accordance with 
Article 4, paragraph 14, 
of the Paris Agreement, 
as appropriate;  
 
 
 
 
See 5(a) above. 
d) IPCC methodologies and 
metrics used for estimat-
ing anthropogenic green-
house gas emissions and 
removals;  
Fiji’s emissions for CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 
and NF3 will be derived using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
and the IPCC 2013 Wetland supplement. The tier of 
methodology used will depend on the data that is availa-
ble in different sectors.

The aggregation of GHG emissions have been estimated, 
and will be reported, using the 100-year time-horizon 
global warming potential values from the IPCC Fifth 
Assessment Report. 
e) Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and approaches 
consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, including, as applicable:  
i. Approach to addressing 
emissions and subsequent 
removals from natural 
disturbances on managed 
lands;  
N/A 
ii. ii. Approach used to ac-
count for emissions and 
removals from harvested 
wood products;  
N/A 
iii. iii. Approach used to ad-
dress the effects of age-
class structure in forests;  
N/A 
f) Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for understanding the na-
tionally determined contribution and, if applicable, estimating corresponding emis-
sions and removals, including:  
i. How the reference indi-
cators, baseline(s) and/or 
reference level(s), includ-
ing, where applicable, 
sector-, category- or ac-
tivity-specific 
reference 
levels, are constructed, 
including, for example, 
key parameters, assump-
tions, definitions, meth-
odologies, data sources 
and models used;  
The NEXSTEP methodology was adopted in the energy 
sector emissions estimation for three major gases – CO2, 
N2O and CH4, displayed as the carbon dioxide equiva-
lent (CO2-e). The emission has been estimated using the 
Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) tool where 
total amount of fuel used (either in the demand side or in 
the supply side) is multiplied by the total environmental 
loading taken from LEAP’s Technology and Environ-
mental Database which uses 2006 IPCC Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and any further 
refinements and updates applied to these inventories.  
The emissions presented used Global Warming Potential

tial of bilateral, regional and multilateral market-based 
cooperation, including in the context of Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement to support the achievement of its own 
NDC and to provide additional mitigation outcomes to 
support NDC attainment by other countries.

6. How the Party considers that its NDC is fair and ambitious in light of its national 
circumstances 
a) How the Party considers 
that its nationally deter-
mined contribution is fair 
and ambitious in the light 
of its national circum-
stances; 
 
Fiji is committed to leading by example in reaching net-
zero carbon emissions despite its negligible contribution 
of 0.006% to global GHG emissions. In this NDC up-
date, Fiji seeks to demonstrate its commitment to deliv-
ering on its climate action plans to help translate an al-
ready ambitious target into on-the -ground implementa-
tion. Furthermore, this NDC update recognises that the 
cost of implementing this target currently stands at US$ 
2.97 billion between 2017 -20305. This is an exorbitant 
financial challenge compounded by competing adapta-
tion and disaster risk challenges the country faces, all of 
which are exacerbated by the COVID19 economic crisis. 
b) Fairness considerations, 
including reflecting on 
equity;  
c) How the Party has ad-
dressed Article 4, para-
graph 3, of the Paris 
Agreement;  
 
Fiji’s updated NDC reflects a commitment to economy-
wide net-zero emissions by 2050. Through its Low 
Emission Development Strategy, Fiji has mapped out a 
low carbon pathway for each of its sectors. To achieve 
this core objective, the Low Emission Development 
Strategy has elaborated four possible low emission sce-
narios for each sector including electricity and other 
energy use, land transport, domestic maritime transport, 
domestic air transport, agriculture, forestry and other 
land use, coastal wetlands and waste. The Strategy esti-
mates that Fiji’s emissions would more than double un-
der the “business as usual (BAU)” unconditional scenar-
io, grow incrementally under the BAU Conditional sce-
nario, drop by nearly 31% under the High Ambition 
scenario and achieve net negative emissions during the 
year 2041 under the Very High Ambition scenario.

Agreement.

set out in its Article 2 
a) How the nationally de-
termined 
contribution 
contributes 
towards 
achieving the objective of 
the Convention as set out 
in its Article 2;  
Developing a long-term strategy and vision on sector 
transformation through the Low Emission Development 
Strategy has helped establish a clear understanding of 
the low carbon transition pathway ahead and provides a 
longer-term perspective for raising the ambition of 
NDC. Fiji considers this as a stepping-stone towards

carbon neutrality by 2050. 
 
Additionally, Fiji’s response to climate change will be 
enabled, in part, through the Climate Change Bill to 
improve consistency of practices to reduce GHG emis-
sions in line with the NDC and the 2050 pathway as well 
as reduce risks to people and to the environment. Fiji’s 
Climate Change Bill will help to improve the scope, 
enforcement, and value-added potential of the use of 
standards as a way to adjust business-as-usual behav-
iours and instigate behaviour change. The Climate 
Change Bill will also set precedence for other nations to 
embed their NDC commitments into national law. The 
intent to enact the Climate Change Bill further reinforces 
Fiji's commitment to mitigate its carbon emissions and 
play a leading role in global and regional climate change 
advocacy.

termined 
contribution

the Paris Agreement.  
2. Fiji’s Adaptation Component of the NDC Update 
 
2.1 
Background 
According to the IPCC Special Report, the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing 
Climate, which was released in 2019, climate adaptation is expected to be signif-
icantly more challenging for ecosystems, food and health systems at 2°C of glob-
al warming above the pre-industrial age than for 1.5°C (medium confidence). 
Even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C, vulnerable regions, including the 
Small Island Developing States, are projected to experience a multitude of inter-
related climate risks, resulting in loss of livelihoods, food insecurity and large-
scale population displacement. Fiji recognises this reality, as it lies on the front 
line of adverse climate change impacts and will be facing some of the most se-
vere climate-related challenges in the coming decade. These range from pro-
longed droughts, changes in the hydrological cycle resulting in intense floods, 
and extreme weather events, to rising sea levels and its resultant saltwater intru-
sion and loss of habitable land. This has already led to partial and complete relo-
cation of six climate vulnerable communities, with many more regions in the 
country being threatened by similar consequences.  
 
The impacts of climate change are affecting all aspects of life for Fijians - the 
environment, economy, social development, as well as cultural practices and 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-17- 
traditional ways of life. Fiji is facing loss and degradation of vital ecosystems and 
natural resources, including its coral reefs, coasts and catchments, on which key 
sectors of its economy such as agriculture and fisheries are dependant. Further, 
its critical infrastructure- including electricity and water stations, schools and 
hospitals – are frequently damaged by the increasing extreme weather events, 
which are impacting the social well-being, employment and livelihoods of the 
Fijian people.   
 
2.2 
Quantifying Climate Vulnerability and Adaptation Needs 
 
In 2017, Fiji completed its comprehensive Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
(CVA)6 of the country and economy, on the basis of which it identified priority 
focus areas to be addressed through climate adaptation measures. The CVA pro-
jected that by 2050, over 6.5 per cent of Fiji’s GDP could be lost due to tropical 
cyclones and floods, with the number of people being pushed into poverty every 
year increasing by 25 per cent. In addition, long-term climate change will affect 
health in Fiji, with impacts including rise in vector-borne diseases (such as den-
gue fever), water-borne diseases and non-communicable diseases which are sen-
sitive to temperatures (such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases). 
 
To build the requisite domestic capacity, Fiji is committed to taking proactive 
steps to reduce its vulnerability and enhance the resilience of its communities, 
environment and economy. This is being done through developing policies, insti-
tutions and budgetary systems for mobilising resources toward climate change 
and disaster risk management, including a focus on developing domestic capaci-
ties and on transparent communication and robust monitoring systems so as to 
                                                      
6 Climate Vulnerability Assessment, 2017 
Fiji’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
The CVA provides a blueprint for urgent climate actions and quantifies the resources 
needed to climate-proof Fiji.  
 
To mitigate climate impact, the CVA proposed 125 interventions in five key areas, 
aligned with Fiji’s development plans and goals, to improve the resilience capacity of 
the country.  
 
These focus areas were integrated to be addressed under the National Adaptation 
Plan  through measures such as risk-informed land use planning and housing 
policies, developing resilient infrastructure, climate smart adaptation in agriculture 
and fishery sectors, environmental protection and conservation of key ecosystems 
and the protection of vulnerable population through targeted gender interventions.

ensure equity, justice, inclusion, transparency, and accountability in all climate 
actions. 
 
2.3 
Holistic Approach to Mainstreaming Adaptation and Resilience 
 
 
Fiji’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP), which was launched in 2018, focuses on 
shifting existing and future development planning processes towards a holistic 
pathway of climate-resilience. The initiatives encapsulated in the NAP, are well 
aligned with the requirements for enhancing adaptation actions in Fiji’s NDC, 
especially as these were based on the insights garnered from the CVA, which in 
its turn entailed a comprehensive mapping of on-the-ground issues. Further, the 
NAP was the result of extensive inter-ministerial deliberations with multi-
stakeholder engagements and inputs of technical experts from the private sector, 
civil society and academia, and sub-national Government representatives, making 
the measures listed under it robust and with potential of being effectively imple-
mented. 
 
2.4 
Fiji’s Commitment to Adaptation Actions with Mitigation Co-benefits 
Fiji’s inherent vulnerability to climate induced disaster is exacerbated by the 
growing impacts of climate change which threaten to negate years of develop-
ment progress.  
Transitioning towards a low carbon economy and achieving the decarbonisation 
targets of this NDC Update will require substantial resource mobilisation for 
climate adaptation. Investments in climate adaptation now will not only help 
ensure that investments in renewable solutions are sustainable and resilient to 
Fiji’s National Adaptation Plan 
The NAP contains 160 adaptation measures to be prioritised over its five-year time 
frame, split across a total of 10 components.  
This entails five systems components which are required to instigate a paradigm shift 
and create an enabling environment for increase investment flows to adaptation and 
an addtional five sectoral components which are actions for addressing the 
vulnerability of society and the economy to the impacts of climate change.  
Under its NAP process, Fiji envisions three additional stages to ensure effectiveness 
of its planned adaptations measures. These are the development of a monitoring and 
evaluation system, the development of a communication plan and the forumaltion of a 
financing plan. 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020

climate adversities but also lower the inherently high risk of doing business in the 
Pacific.  
In this regard, Fiji commits to the following adaptation actions in this NDC Up-
date: 
1. Climate change is a shared responsibility and Fiji will make efforts to 
mobilize domestic and new investments toward sustainable development 
pathways by following an evaluation and learning-based approach, with a 
focus on building synergies and bridging its internal capacity and resource 
gaps.  
 
2. Fiji will promote sustainable and resilient development by enabling key 
stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels and strengthening the role 
of its local government bodies to make informed decisions regarding the use 
of natural resources. 
 
3. To enhance the adaptive capacity of its economy and communities, Fiji will 
endeavour to produce and make accessible reliable, robust, and updated 
climate information, including projections for impacts of climate change.  
 
4. Fiji will take measures to ensure that public infrastructure is resilient to 
cyclones and floods, prioritizing nature-based economically viable solutions, 
and developing future infrastructure and building projects while keeping in 
mind the effects of climate change. 
 
5. Fiji will undertake measures under a comprehensive and integrated water 
resource management approach to conserve and enhance the productivity of 
its freshwater sources and ensure their judicious and equitable use. 
 
6. Fiji will prioritize the conservation and protection of its marine biodiversity 
and critical ocean ecosystems. This would include measures for promoting 
sustainable 
fishing 
practices, 
coastal 
protection, 
preservation, 
and 
enhancement of its mangroves, and engaging with coastal communities to 
promote sustainable practices and livelihoods. 
 
7. Fiji will ensure that comprehensive multi-hazard and risk assessments are 
conducted to inform the planning and development of climate-resilient 
human settlements.  
 
8. Fiji will focus on mitigating and protecting all Fijians from the worst effects 
of natural disasters by ensuring that the housing stock (both existing and 
Fiji’s Updated NDC 2020 
-20- 
future) is strengthened to withstand extreme events and that climate-resilient 
upgrading of informal settlements is prioritised. 
 
9. Fiji commits to strengthening the resilience of its agriculture sector to ensure 
national food security, and to diversify the dependence on the sector by 
promoting sustainable livelihood opportunities. 
 
10. Fiji will imbibe its traditional values of respecting and living within nature’s 
limits, in its future development plans in the context of its financial, 
technical, and social capacities, and develop robust legislative measures to 
protect and conserve the vulnerable species and ecosystems. 
 
11. Fiji will take appropriate steps to protect its social infrastructure against 
climate change and prioritise gender, disability, and the needs of the children 
and elderly in disaster management and in climate action.  
 
 
3. CONCLUSION 
 
Fiji has successfully analysed the lessons learned since the submission of the first 
NDC and has explored a number of options for enhancement, with an eye to-
wards ambition. 
 
Fiji has involved various stakeholders in comprehensively designing its mitiga-
tion plans and adaptation measures, along with exploring opportunities in new 
sectors such as oceans, nature-based solutions linked to biodiversity protection, 
and health, among others.  
 
However, the brutal economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has placed 
serious fiscal pressure on Fiji. As a direct result, Fiji’s ability to fund sustainable 
development, including resilience-building and the pursuit of carbon neutrality, 
has been severely handicapped.   
 
The strategy, however, is clear. Fiji has managed to outlay a suite of comprehen-
sive mitigation and adaptation measures across multiple sectors which now re-
quire large scale resource mobilisation, rapid technology transfer to lower costs 
and increase viability; robust monitoring and evaluation systems to enable con-
tinuous improvements and dynamic communications plans to build climate 
awareness for the full implementation of its necessary climate adaptation plans 
and mitigation ambitions.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC)

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

(b) 
Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France 
47,5%, Croatia 16,7%, Italy 43,7%, Cyprus 32%, Latvia 17%, 
Lithuania 21%, Luxembourg 50%, Hungary 18,7%, Malta 19%, 
Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows: 
Belgium -320Kt CO2eq, Bulgaria -1163kt CO2eq, Czechia -827kt

(c) 
How the Party’s preparation of its nationally determined 
contribution has 
been informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement; 
The EU shall set its climate target in accordance with the European Climate 
Law. To that end, at the latest within 6 months of the first Global Stocktake, 
the Commission shall make a legislative proposal, as appropriate, on a Union-
wide climate target for 2040 based on a detailed impact assessment, as per 
article 4.3 of the European Climate Law REGULATION (EU) 2021/1119 OF 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 
30 June 2021. 
 
17 
 
(d) 
 
 
 
 
 
(i) 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures 
have been considered in developing the nationally determined 
contribution; 
 
Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented 
to contribute to mitigation co-benefits, including information 
on adaptation plans that also yield mitigation co-benefits, 
which may cover, but are not limited to, key sectors, such as 
energy, resources, water resources, coastal resources, human 
settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a

GEORGIA
1.1
TARGETS
The goal of nationally determined contribution of Georgia is to support the 
sustainable and balanced development of the country, equally taking into 
consideration climate change, environmental and socio-economic challenges. 
The nationally determined contribution of Georgia is as follows:
Georgia is committed to a target of 50-57% of its total greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, in case of international support. 
If the world will follow 2OC average global temperature increase 
holding scenario, reduction of emissions by 50% will be necessary 
while in case of limiting increase to 1.5OC, it will be necessary to 
reduce emissions by 57% compared to 1990 level;
The updated NDC of Georgia sets 2030 Climate Change Strategy and 
Action Plan for the determination of mitigation measures contributing 
achievement of unconditional and conditional commitments and 
mitigation targets;
Georgia is fully committed1 to an unconditional limiting target of 35 
% below 1990 level of its domestic total greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2030;2
1
2
3
Georgia is committed to continue studying its adaptive capacity of 
different economic sectors to the negative effects of climate change, 
as well as to plan and implement the respective adaptation measures 
by mobilising domestic and international resources for the sectors 
particularly vulnerable to climate change.

8
1.	 The commitment does not cover Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region of Georgia, since these are the 
temporarily occupied territories and the Government of Georgia has no effective control over them. 
2.	 Such reduction is approximately equal to reducing the aggregate GHG emissions by 16% per capita.

1.2
TARGET TIMEFRAME
Georgia has determined the next decade, between 1st January 2021 
and 31st December 2030, to be the timeframe for the implementation 
of the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution.

3.	 In case of recalculation all following years are also subject to update in accordance with the time 
series consistency principle. 
Adaptation to adverse effects of climate change covers the most 
vulnerable sectors of the economy, ecosystems and other natural 
resources:6 mountain ecosystems, Black Sea coastal zone, tourism, 
agriculture, surface and ground water resources, forestry and 
biodiversity;
4.	 The emission limitations/removals from the categories of land use, land use change and forestry is 
excluded from the projections until the statistical data of the land category changes will be designed, 
except the firewood consumption

Georgia plans to continue, as far as possible, recording carbon 
storages of managed forests and soil from the following sources: 
above ground biomass, below ground biomass, litter, deadwood and 
soil organic carbon;
10
In the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Georgia plans to continue, 
as far as possible, recording the greenhouse gases not regulated by 
the Montreal Protocol5, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3);

1.5
AMBITION & FAIRNESS
In 2015, total national greenhouse gas emissions (excluding those 
from land use, land-use change and forestry) accounted approximately 
39% of emissions recorded in 1990;
Georgia’s updated unconditional target limits national greenhouse 
gas emissions average annual growth rate approximately to 3.0% 
instead of 5.7% that was estimated for the last decade under the 
Fourth National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report;

Georgia’s population, induced by the climate change during the last 
decades, reveals the following vulnerable groups requiring urgent 
adaptation measures: children and adolescents, women, elderly 
persons, persons with disabilities, persons with chronic diseases, and 
eco-migrants displaced as a result of disasters caused by climate 
change or those, who are threatened to be eco migrated due to the 
climate change.
12
With its updated NDC Georgia sets more ambitious targets that 
exceed its precedent NDC targets by 7% (unconditional) and 10-17% 
(conditional), respectively; 
With its updated NDC, Georgia takes a commitment to fairly 
contributing to the global efforts against climate change, taking 
into consideration national circumstances, resources and capacities. 
Georgia recognizes that it is vital for the world society to share the 
required efforts against global warming in a fair and equitable manner.

Since 1994, Georgia has been a Non-Annex I Party to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In 1999 
Georgia accessed the Kyoto Protocol, in 2017 approved to the Paris 
Agreement and in 2020 accessed the Doha’s Amendment to Kyoto 
Protocol;
2.2
ECONOMIC PROFILE
Georgia acknowledges the importance of ongoing economic 
development dynamics of the country from the standpoint of updating 
the NDC document;
The updated NDC envisages that on the basis of a small, open and 
transitional market economy, Georgia is a developing country with 
upper-middle income level (World bank Group, 2019). In 2019, GDP 
per capita amounted to USD 4,764 (GeoStat, 2020), while the annual 
(real) GDP growth accounted for 4.7% in 2000-2019;
Georgia recognizes the substantial role of municipalities in the 
achievement of the NDC and for joint development of 2030 
Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans invites all parties at the 
municipal level, who will be a member of the EU Initiative - Covenant 
of Mayors for Climate and Energy by the year of 2024.
23
24
22
15
The updated NDC envisages that the foreign trade turnover 
(only goods) amounts to approximately 75% of GDP, although 
the country’s international position is not desirable, since import 
rates are significantly higher than export rates. By 2019, the most 
volatile macroeconomic variable – Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) 
–amounted to around 1,311 million USD (GeoStat, 2020). The main 
climate-related macroeconomic variables are summarized below (see 
Table 1);
25
Georgia’s updated NDC also envisages that the service sector is 
dominant in the Georgian economy and its share amounts to 69% in 
total economic activities. The shares of industry and agriculture in the 
total economic activities are approximately 23% and 8%, respectively;

Given that the average growth rate of the greenhouse gas emissions 
has been around 4.3% over the past 18 years, Georgia’s updated 
Nationally Determined Contribution emphasizes a number of factors 
that affect the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, such as Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) real growth rate, demographic situation, 
investments, prices in the energy sector, technological progress, 
energy consumption, behavior and attitudes, and so forth. The real 
GDP growth and energy consumption are key drivers of greenhouse 
gas emissions in Georgia;
Georgia notes that due to several reasons, including economic 
recessions, institutional instabilities, external factors (global crises, 
trade embargo, economic crises in neighboring countries, energy price 
shocks, etc.), the trend of the country’s greenhouse gas emission is 
not stable and is characterized by high volatility;
27
28
17
Georgia acknowledges that there is a high correlation between 
emission-intensive activities (transport, energy supply, agriculture, 
et.c) and the real GDP. The rate of Emission-intensive economic 
activities has been gradually growing over the last decade. The 
average growth rate of such activities makes 3.6%, which is lower 
than the GDP growth rate (4.7%) (see Table 2).

Georgia’s updated NDC highlights the vulnerability of mountainous 
areas, given the fact that most of the country’ mountainous areas, 
especially those with the elevation of 1,000 meters and above sea-
level, are greatly affected by extreme weather and related geological 
events;
Due to the changed climatic parameters and extreme weather 
conditions for the past several decades, Georgia emphasizes that 
the country’s coastal zone is characterized by high vulnerability to 
climate change;

2.5
CLIMATE PROFILE
In the light of information provided in the National Communications 
of the country, Georgia’s updated NDC underlines that average 
temperature is characterized by an increasing trend in most of the 
regions of the country for the past several decades and produces 
high-risk changes both in climatic and agricultural zones.
Georgia also draws attention to the fact that 43.5% of the country’s 
territory is covered by forests and aims to maintain and increase the 
GHG absorption and adaptation capacities of the forests.

procedures and database for the archive system of the national 
anthropogenic emissions by national sources and removals by sinks 
of greenhouse gases by 2024;
Georgia aims at developing the country-specific emission factors and 
activity data, where available, in order to address the recommended 
methods (tier levels) for the key source categories in accordance with 
the IPCC 2006 guidelines; 
Georgia recognizes the national circumstances, specifically absence 
of relevant historical data necessary for utilization of higher tier 
methodologies, and intends to use the splicing techniques suggested 
by the IPCC guidelines under the national inventory reports of 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of 
greenhouse gases, in order to ensure consistent time series and 
estimate missing emission values resulting from lack of activity data, 
emission factors or other parameters;

of these regions;
Georgia intends to assess the impact of climate change on the 
availability of groundwater and surface water resources for 
sustainable use in agricultural (irrigation), energy production and 
dwelling purposes in a long-term perspective;
Georgia intends to assess and develop adaptive capacities for the 
agricultural productions that have the largest share in national 
GDP (e.g. grape, hazelnut, tangerine) and/or for domestic unique 
products (such as Georgian honey, non-timber forest products). This 
process will be implemented in accordance with assessing changes of

energy efficiency measures and efficient use of water resources in 
households;
Georgia’s updated NDC acknowledges the nationalization of targets 
5.1-5.6, 5.a, and 5.b of Sustainable Development Goal 5 on the 
achievement of gender equality and empowerment all women and 
girls; 
Given that the majority of teachers at primary and secondary schools, 
58%7 of lecturers at universities, and 65%8 of doctors are women, 
Georgia intends empowering women as agents of change through 
involving them in decision-making processes addressing healthcare 
issues induced by climate change and related to the activities and 
programs, such as awareness raising on climate change, capacity-
building and knowledge-sharing aiming at changing behavior;

ANNEXES
7.1
Best practices and experience related to the 
preparation of the Nationally Determined 
Contribution of Georgia
Paragraph 12 of Georgia’s updated NDC identifies the vulnerable groups of 
the country. For taking into consideration the particular interests, needs, 
capabilities, roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders, especially the 
vulnerable groups, the meetings with vulnerable groups and civic organizations 
working on climate change and gender issues have been conducted during the 
process of updating the document.
The Government of Georgia has established a governmental advisory body 
- the Climate Change Council - for implementing and tracking the updated 
Nationally Determined Contribution. The Council represents an instrument for 
ensuring transparency in climate policy implementation in order to achieve the 
emission targets set out in this document.
38
7.2
Assumptions and methodological approaches, 
including those for estimating and accounting for 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as 
appropriate, removals
Georgia is going to report a greenhouse gas inventory pursuant to the 
decision 18/CMA.1 and report on progress towards its Nationally Determined 
Contribution in accordance to 4/CMA.1 until 31 December 2024.
Georgia continues to use 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories and 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands, for estimating greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals. The sectoral targets for mitigation stated in the 
updated NDC follows the assumptions and methodologies used by the Climate 
Strategy and Action Plan. The EX-Ante Carbon-balance Tool version 7 has been 
applied for mitigation targets setting in the Forest sector. The LEAP has been 
applied for estimation of the greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emission 
limitations in energy related sectors.

7.3
The current dynamics of Georgia’s population
As of January 1, 2020, the population of Georgia was 3.7 million,9 of which 2.2 
million (59%) lived in urban areas and 1.5 million (41%) lived in rural areas 
(Geostat, 2020). In general, the population of Georgia decreased by approx-
imately 32% between 1993 and 2014. The same downward trend has been 
recorded for the urban and rural population. Particularly, the urban population 
has decreased by 27%, while the decreasing trend for rural population was 
significantly higher approximately 31.7% for the same 21 years period. The 
migration is considered as one of the main causes for the decrease of Georgia’s 
population by ¼. Additionally, the urbanization processes in the country keeps 
the people migration rate relatively high in villages of Georgia.
The projections for population growth up to 2030 have been provided by analy-
sis of trends of population changes in Georgia (Geostat, 2020) since the year of 
1990 and the studies provided by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA, 
2015). The main drivers for projecting future population growth up to 2030 
are total fertility rate and growth rate offered by UNFPA. The drives and key 
assumptions are outlined below:
40
9.	 The data does not cover the occupied territories of Georgia
	
L
The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for Georgia is considered 2.06 (World Bank 
Group, 2018);
	
L
The latest data of Georgia’s population is provided by the National Statistics 
Office of Georgia; 
	
L
The population growth projections for the next decade when the new static 
data cannot be used, are developed by making proportional adjustment 
UNFPA estimates (UNFPA, 2015) made in the past;
	
L
The population growth rate is estimated by the use of overlap method:
	

	

where:
	

Y0 – the recalculated population estimate computed using the overlap 
method;
	

x0 – the statistical data;
	

Yi and xi are the projections prepared using the statistical and UNFPA 
data during the period of overlap, as denoted by years m through n.

Information on people returned to Georgia during the period of COVID-19 
pandemic are incorporated in the population projections (approx. 20,000);
	
L
In addition to the population, the average annualized number of tourists 
stayed in Georgia in 2019 was approx. 122,000;
	
L
It is assumed that the annualized number of tourists recorded for the year 
of 2019 will be recovered within 2 – 3 years after the Covid-19 pandemic 
crisis.
41
7.4
Methods applied
42
	
L
In 2015 the national Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report was published 
under Georgia’s Second Biennial Update Report. Pursuant to the report 
uncertainty of the greenhouse gas emissions’ trend is ±13.26%. The 
uncertainty analysis is conducted in accordance with the Decision 20 / CP.7 
and its basic method is described in the IPCC 2006 guidelines. 
	
L
In the preparation of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory document, 
improvements in the emissions estimates are taken into account and 
uncertainty trend is considered to be improved approximately by 8.5% that 
is in accordance with +4.731% interval uncertainty trend.
	
L
Positive significance of the uncertainty trend is considered for the 
development of unconditional commitment of updated NDC while prognosis 
of the conditional commitment are based on 2OC and 1,5OC temperature 
increase scenarios of the IPCC assessment reports. 
	
L
Sectoral targets until 2030 are set by calculating projection scenarios of 
greenhouse gas emissions that are based on Georgia’s Updated second 
Biennial Report (BUR) published in 2019 and Georgia’s recent National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reports. LEAP model has been used as a 
comprehensive platform for gathering and calibration of the data from 
every individual sector (except Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry 
(LULUCF)). Data of the Forestry sector was evaluated by using the FAO EX-
ACT model.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of

approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies. 
(c) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris 
Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a 
(d) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France 
47,5%, Croatia 16,7%, Italy 43,7%, Cyprus 32%, Latvia 17%,

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows:

(ii) 
Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures 
have been considered in developing the nationally determined 
contribution; 
 
Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented

on adaptation plans that also yield mitigation co-benefits, 
which may cover, but are not limited to, key sectors, such as 
energy, resources, water resources, coastal resources, human 
settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA. 
6 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Page 2 of 15 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Grenada’s second Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pursuant to Article 4 of the Paris 
Agreement represents its continued commitment to the objectives of the Paris Agreement towards 
holding the increase of the global average temperature to well below 2oC above pre-industrial 
levels while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5oC.  
 
This NDC adheres to the requirements of the guidance on information to facilitate clarity, 
transparency and understanding (ICTU) as contained in decision 4/ CMA 1 adopted at the 
twenty-fourth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 24)  serving as the first Meeting of the 
Parties to the Paris Agreement. 
 
The emissions reductions in this new NDC are a confirmation of the indicative ambitious 2030 
NDC target of 40% below 2010 levels submitted in the 2016 NDC, which is conditional on external 
funding. This target remains the highest possible ambition that Grenada can achieve. It is 
anticipated that this will be done through interventions in the Energy including transport; Waste; 
Forestry; and Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) sectors and by leveraging mitigation 
co-benefits of adaptation actions.  
 
Due to changing and unforeseen circumstances, the indicative 2030 target represents a more 
significant effort on the part of the state of Grenada than when it was initially proposed.  Grenada 
will make every effort to meet and exceed the targets laid out in this NDC. 
 
The NDC review process led by the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC), followed a 
multi-sectoral, whole of society approach which consisted of engagements with key ministries, 
public and private sector stakeholders, academic and technical experts, civil society 
organizations, and vulnerable and marginalized groups.  
 
The Government of Grenada is appreciative of the support provided by the Regional Collaboration 
Centre (RCC) St. George’s, and the NDC Partnership through its implementation partners Climate 
Analytics (CA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Global Green Growth 
Institute (GGGI),  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),  the Organization of Eastern States 
(OECS), the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), and UNICEF. 
 
Grenada is also committed to linking the NDC implementation to its national policy framework as 
expressed in the following policy documents and programmes, inter alia: National Climate Change 
Policy; National Sustainable Development Plan 2035; National Adaptation Plan (NAP); National 
Youth Policy; Gender Equality Policy and Action Plan; Green Climate Fund Country Programme; 
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy; Basic Needs Trust Fund; Support for Education, 
Empowerment and Development; Climate Smart Cities and the Climate-Smart Rural Enterprise 
Development Programme. 
 
 
Means of Implementation 
 
To fully implement the mitigation measures contained in this NDC, Grenada will require grants 
and other concessional finance, support for capacity building and institutional strengthening and 
Page 3 of 15 
 
access to appropriate technologies. The indicative cost for Grenada’s identified NDC mitigation 
measures through 2030 is between $984.9 and $1,054.5 Million USD.  
 
Grenada anticipates implementing the NDC through access to multilateral and bilateral support 
including through the Green Climate Fund, multilateral agencies, and bilateral arrangements with 
development partners. These funds will be used to leverage the limited national resources and 
technical capacities that are available for responding to climate change.  
 
The NDC Partnership, the UNDP Climate Promise, UNICEF and the OECS Commission, will 
support the country in developing an implementation plan, a communications plan  and a financing 
strategy with concrete measures and timelines for implementation, in an effort to transition the 
NDC target to real actions and emission reductions. 
 
To the extent possible, given the limited domestic fiscal space and the economic constraints 
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the government will adopt a comprehensive, holistic, and 
multi-sectoral approach to low-carbon development and climate resilience.

plans, including description 
of specific projects, 
measures and initiatives of 
Parties’ adaptation actions 
In accordance with Grenada’s National Climate Change Policy, the 
implementation vehicles for the policy’s objectives, strategies and outcomes are 
the NDC and NAP. Delivery of the actions articulated in each document will 
ensure the operational components of the policy.  
Grenada’s NAP (2017-2021) along with projects currently under implementation 
include mitigation co-benefits. The reductions emerging from these contribute 
towards the target as outlined in 1(d) and should not be considered additional.  
 
Page 6 of 15 
 
and/or economic 
diversification plans.  
Grenada is also committed to continue reporting data and information on 
quantified co-benefits of adaptation actions in its NAP and National 
communications.  
 
Mitigation actions within adaptation projects will be captured through the data 
collection framework and GHG inventory and reported in the respective sectors.  
4. Planning process 
(a) Information on the 
planning processes that 
the Party undertook to 
prepare its NDC and, if 
available, on the Party’s 
implementation plans, 
including, as appropriate:  
(i) Domestic institutional 
arrangements, public 
participation and 
engagement with local 
communities and 
indigenous peoples, in a 
gender-responsive 
manner; 
Grenada’s NDC planning process was led by the National Climate Change 
Committee (NCCC) and involved the following steps:  
- 
A technical committee as a sub-group from the NCCC was formed in 
2018 and comprised of representatives from the relevant ministries 
(Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment; 
the Energy Division in the Ministry of Infrastructure Development, Public 
Utilities, Energy, Transport and Implementation). 
 
- 
Several workshops were held with key stakeholders to develop strategies 
and initiatives and to identify the possible data sources that will be 
needed to update the NDC.  
 
- 
Following several consultations and validation workshops in 2018 and 
2019, the ensuing Grenada NDC Plan was endorsed by the Government 
of Grenada (GoG). 
 
- 
The GoG then sought support from NDC Partnership for technical 
assistance for the revision of Grenada’s NDC through the Climate Action 
Enhancement Package (CAEP).  
 
- 
Throughout most of 2020, representatives from relevant ministries, 
implementing partners, private sector entities, technical experts and civil 
society were engaged at different stages of the development process for 
their inputs to updating the NDC. 
 
- 
The final NDC draft was subjected to a series of consultations with all key 
stakeholders and subsequently submitted to Cabinet for endorsement 
and authorization for submission to the UNFCCC.  
(ii) Contextual matters, 
including, inter alia (among 
other things), as 
appropriate:  
(a) National 
circumstances, such as 
geography, climate, 
economy, sustainable 
development, and poverty 
eradication; 
Geography: 
Grenada 
is 
a 
small 
island 
developing state located in the south-eastern 
Caribbean and is comprised of three islands, 
Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique. The 
combined land area is 345km2 and is the 
southernmost 
of 
the 
Windward 
Islands.  
Grenada’s location coordinates are 12.07° N, 
61.40° W. 
 
Climate: Grenada has a humid tropical marine 
climate with little seasonal or diurnal (daily) 
variation and a constant, strong (""trade"") wind out 
of the east. This climate is affected mainly by the 
subtropical cyclone belt and the intertropical 
convergence zone. The location of these two 
Page 7 of 15 
 
meteorological systems varies in a cyclical 
pattern, and their movement gives a seasonal 
character to the weather. Rain tends to be 
showery and is distributed roughly into a drier 
season from January to May and a wetter season 
from June to December. Average temperature 
ranges between 28-33°C while rainfall ranges 
between 1000-4000 mm depending on the 
elevation and location with variations observed in 
the rainfall and drought due to El Niño Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomena. 
 
Grenada is very vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change and is already experiencing 
climate change and its impacts. This is evidenced 
by increased average temperatures; variations in 
rainfall patterns with  longer dry seasons and 
shorter rainy seasons resulting in increased 
incidence of drought; and sea level rise which has 
resulted in coastal degradation and intrusion of 
saline water into aquifers, among others. 
 
Economy: Grenada is classified as an upper 
middle-income country. Over the past two 
decades, the economy changed from being 
predominantly agriculture-based (production of 
sugar cane, cocoa, nutmeg, and banana) to 
services 
dominated 
(tourism, 
real 
estate, 
education, 
and 
construction). 
Grenada’s 
economy was buffeted during the 2000s due to 
Hurricane Ivan in 2004 (the damages inflicted by 
exceeded 200% of the country’s GDP); Hurricane 
Emily in 2005; the global food and oil price shock 
in 2008; the global financial crisis in 2009; and the 
extreme drought in 2010.  Grenada made a 
notable recovery and between 2011-2018, the 
real GDP growth averaged at 3.7% and per capita 
income rose persistently. Even though Grenada 
has seen a consistent rise in real GDP and per 
capita growth, the impacts of Covid-19 threaten 
this growth going forward given, in most part, 
Grenada’s economy relies heavily on tourism and 
agriculture. 
 
Sustainable 
Development: 
The 
National 
Sustainable Development Plan is the anchor for 
Grenada’s development agenda and priorities 
over the period 2020-2035. It puts forward 
strategic priorities that have been identified to 
address crucial social, economic, environmental, 
and other development challenges.  It envisions 
the workings of an economy and society that is 
premised on genuine partnership in which the 
public sector, private sector, civil society, and 
Page 8 of 15 
 
wider 
non-state 
actors 
share 
collective 
responsibility 
for 
Grenada’s 
sustainable 
development and plays complementary roles in 
the process of nation building. Grenada’s 
government is committed to social inclusion on 
the national level and is also striving for a more 
comprehensive involvement of the country’s 
diaspora. 
 
Poverty: The most recent snapshot of poverty in 
Grenada comes from the 2008 Country Poverty 
Assessment. 37.7% of the population was 
deemed to be poor and 2.4 % was deemed to be 
indigent. Children (persons aged 0-14) and 
youths (persons 15-24) accounted for 66.4% of 
the poor. Grenada is actively trying to eradicate 
poverty through its flagship poverty reduction 
programmes: Growth and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy, the  Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF) 
and Support for Education, Empowerment and 
Development (SEED) as well as the Climate-
Smart Rural Enterprise Development Programme 
(SAEP).  
Inclusiveness: Grenada has anchored inclusivity 
as a cornerstone of its development process. The 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
successful 2013-2017 Structural Adjustment 
Process was led by a Committee of Social 
Partners chaired by the  Prime Minister and which 
included stakeholders from the major societal 
groupings - private sector, NGO’s, trade unions, 
gender and youth, academia and faith based 
organizations. The development of national 
policies and strategies including the annual 
Budget includes processes to ensure that key 
stakeholders are consulted. The resulting policies 
therefore reflect the inputs from key stakeholder 
groupings and provide a framework that serves as 
a guide to the public sector, private sector, labour, 
and civil society. 
(b) Best practices and 
experience related to the 
preparation of the NDC; 
Grenada’s best practices in the preparation of the 
NDC are as follows: 
Inclusiveness and Engagement: The process 
was characterized by its inclusiveness and 
consultative nature albeit in mostly virtual 
sessions due to Covid-19 and the need to adhere 
to the attendant protocols. All key stakeholders at 
both the governmental and non- governmental 
levels were fully involved and meaningfully 
engaged in major decision making over the NDC 
preparation period in 2020. 
Page 9 of 15 
 
Linkages and Ownership: The NDC has been 
integrally linked and consistent with other relevant 
policies in particular, the National Climate Change 
Policy, The National Adaptation Plan, The 
National Sustainable Development Plan 2035 and 
the national planning and budgeting process. The 
NDC preparation was also characterized by high 
level ownership as senior government officials 
and non-government practitioners have endorsed 
the content of the NDC and expressed their 
commitment to its full implementation. 
Partnership: Through the NDC Partnership as 
the anchor, Grenada with the support of the 
Regional Collaboration Centre partnered with 
several regional and international organizations to 
determine a robust and practical NDC based on 
the latest science, methodologies, guidance, and 
applications.  
(c) Other contextual 
aspirations and priorities 
acknowledged when 
joining the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
Grenada remains committed to linking the NDC 
implementation to the country’s Sustainable 
Development Goals agenda as reflected in 
Grenada’s Sustainable Development Plan 2020-
2035, with a particular emphasis on development 
outcomes that contribute to building the resilience 
of most vulnerable groups. The government’s 
objective is to maximize the social co-benefits of 
the mitigation measures presented in the NDC.  
 
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Loss and 
Damage: Given Grenada’s vulnerability to 
negative sudden and slow onset processes and 
events 
such 
as 
hurricanes, 
floods, 
and 
environmental degradation,  
 
Grenada will continue to build coherence with the 
NDC and NAP to comprehensively address loss 
and damage. This will include strengthening 
resilience to respond to impacts beyond the limits 
of adaptation and addressing human mobility and 
settlements.  
 
In addition, the government acts within the 
guidelines of the Sendai Framework for Disaster 
Risk 
Reduction 
2015-2030 
to 
protect 
development gains from the risk of disaster.  
 
Human Health: Implementing best available 
technologies could assist in mitigating factors that 
negatively impact respiratory health. Grenada is 
actively building capacity, developing policies, 
and 
implementing 
interventions 
to 
prevent 
morbidity, mortality and attain its SDGs. Key focus 
Page 10 of 15 
 
areas include strengthening capacity to address: 
climate change and health impacts; health 
emergencies and environmental threats and 
risks; and disaster management and risks. 
 
Data Collection: to ensure the future availability 
of quality, disaggregated, useable data, Grenada 
will continue efforts towards the development of a 
national data collection framework for long term 
collection and verification of data.   
 
Grenada will adopt a holistic and multi-sectoral 
approach to low-carbon development and climate 
resilience, which encompasses education, health, 
food security, water and sanitation, housing and 
social protection and to ensure a resilient, 
inclusive, gender-sensitive, and peaceful society.  
(b) Specific information 
applicable to Parties, 
including regional 
economic integration 
organizations and their 
member States, that have 
reached an agreement to 
act jointly under Article 4, 
paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the 
Parties that agreed to act 
jointly and the terms of the 
agreement, in accordance 
with Article 4, paragraphs 
16–18, of the Paris 
Agreement;  
Grenada is not part of an agreement to act jointly under Article 4 of the Paris 
Agreement. 
(c) How the Party’s 
preparation of its NDC has 
been informed by the 
outcomes of the global 
stocktake, in accordance 
with Article 4, paragraph 9, 
of the Paris Agreement;  
Grenada participated in the Talanoa Dialogue and took note of the outcome, 
inputs and outputs as expressed in Decision 1/CP.24 and the invitation from the 
COP to consider the outcome, inputs and outputs of the Talanoa Dialogue in 
preparing nationally determined contributions. 
 
Grenada’s climate policies and targets were therefore developed in the context 
of best available science with the IPCC Special Report on 1.5oC being central to 
the assessment of its NDC. 
(d) Each Party with an NDC 
under Article 4 of the Paris 
Agreement that consists of 
adaptation action and/or 
economic diversification 
plans resulting in 
mitigation co-benefits 
consistent with Article 4, 
paragraph 7, of the Paris 
(i) How the economic and 
social consequences of 
response measures have 
been considered in 
developing the NDC; 
Grenada considered all social, economic, and 
environmental impacts of its domestic mitigation 
measures in developing and implementing the 
NDC. 
 
 
(ii) Specific projects, 
measures and activities to 
be implemented to 
Please refer to Section 3(d) above.

Agreement to submit 
information on:  
contribute to mitigation co-
benefits, including 
information on adaptation 
plans that also yield 
mitigation co-benefits, 
which may cover, but are 
not limited to, key sectors, 
such as energy, 
resources, water 
resources, coastal 
resources, human 
settlements and urban 
planning, agriculture and 
forestry; and economic 
diversification actions, 
which may cover, but are 
not limited to, sectors such 
as manufacturing and 
industry, energy and 
mining, transport and 
communication, 
construction, tourism, real 
estate, agriculture and 
fisheries. 
5. Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) Assumptions and 
methodological approaches 
used for accounting for 
anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals 
corresponding to the Party’s 
nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with 
decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 
31, and accounting 
guidance adopted by the 
CMA;  
Grenada accounted for its anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals using 
the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as guided by 1/CP.21 Article 4, 
paragraph 13 of the Paris Agreement.  
(b) Assumptions and 
methodological approaches 
used for accounting for the 
implementation of policies 
and measures or 
strategies in the nationally 
determined contribution;  
Please see 5(a) above. Grenada will apply specific assumptions and 
methodologies, where relevant, when accounting for the progress of various 
policies and measures or strategies in its Biennial Update Report or Biennial 
Transparency Report. 
(c) If applicable, information 
on how the Party will take 
into account existing 
methods and guidance 
Please refer to 5(a) above. 
Page 12 of 15 
 
under the Convention to 
account for anthropogenic 
emissions and removals, in 
accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris 
Agreement, as appropriate;  
(d) IPCC methodologies 
and metrics used for 
estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals;  
Grenada’s emissions for CO2, CH4, and the F-gases were derived using the Tier 
1 method of the 2006 IPCC guidelines. 
 
(e) Sector-, category- or 
activity-specific 
assumptions, methodologies 
and approaches consistent 
with IPCC guidance, as 
appropriate, including, as 
applicable: 
Energy: A sectoral approach was used to calculate the GHG emissions. 
 
Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land use: The data was sourced from 
FAOSTAT database coupled with field inventory measurements for land-use and 
land-use change and emission factors were estimated using IPCC 2006 
guidelines.  
 
Waste Sector: GHG emissions were estimated by using IPCC waste model 
(IPCC 2006 guidelines). 
 
IPPU: Emissions were estimated using IPCC 2006 guidelines. 
(i) Approach to addressing 
emissions and subsequent 
removals from natural 
disturbances on 
managed lands; 
Where relevant, GHG emissions and removals 
from natural disturbances, were accounted for in 
accordance with the prescribed 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, 
coupled 
with 
field 
inventory 
measurements where applicable. 
 
Field inventory estimates for Grenada and 
measurements for previous hurricane impacts 
across the region were used to estimate potential 
future natural disturbances from forest fires, 
extended moderate drought and major hurricane 
impacts (corresponding floods and landslides). 
Accordingly, an allowance of 23% of the total 
carbon stock in forests, amounting to between 
1,118 Gg CO2 and 1,280 Gg CO2 and equal to 
expected disturbance caused by a single category 
4 hurricane making landfall on Grenada between 
2020 and 2030 was included. 
(ii) Approach used to 
account for emissions and 
removals from harvested 
wood products; 
Not applicable. Harvested wood products (HWP) 
are considered negligible as only a minor fraction 
of Grenada’s national forest area (210 ha) is 
managed for wood production. No changes in 
HWP consumption patterns are expected and the 
respective temporary impact on the carbon cycle 
is therefore considered insignificant.   
(iii) Approach used to 
address the effects of 
Not applicable. National data on the age-class 
structure in forests is currently unavailable. 
Page 13 of 15 
 
age-class structure in 
forests; 
However, recent severe hurricane damage to 
national forest stands combined with the age-
class structure and hurricane impacts reported 
elsewhere in the region lend support to the 
assumption that age-class structure will not 
impact the forest carbon cycle during the NDC 
period. 
(f) Other assumptions and 
methodological 
approaches used for 
understanding the nationally 
determined contribution and, 
if applicable, estimating 
corresponding emissions 
and removals, including: 
(i) How the reference 
indicators, baseline(s) 
and/or reference level(s), 
including, where 
applicable, sector-, 
category- or activity-
specific reference levels, 
are constructed, including, 
for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, 
definitions, methodologies, 
data sources and models 
used; 
The baseline GHG emissions for all sectors were 
calculated using 2006 IPCC guidelines. 
- 
Energy: A sectoral approach was used to 
calculate the GHG emissions.  
- 
Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land 
use: 
The 
data 
was 
sourced 
from 
FAOSTAT database coupled with national 
inventory data and emission factors were 
estimated using IPCC 2006 guidelines.  
- 
Waste: GHG emissions were estimated 
using IPCC waste model (IPCC 2006 
guidelines). 
- 
IPPU: GHG emissions were estimated 
using IPCC 2006 guidelines. 
(ii) For Parties with 
nationally determined 
contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas 
components, information 
on assumptions and 
methodological 
approaches used in 
relation to those 
components, as 
applicable;  
 
 
Not applicable. 
(iii) For climate forcers 
included in nationally 
determined contributions 
not covered by IPCC 
guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers 
are estimated; 
Not applicable. 
(iv) Further technical 
information, as 
necessary; 
Not applicable. 
(g) The intention to use 
voluntary cooperation 
under Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement, if applicable.  
Grenada currently uses no market mechanisms but is willing to explore its 
potential along with other mechanisms under the UNFCCC process that 
demonstrate environmental integrity.

6. How the Party considers that its NDC is fair and ambitious in light of its national 
circumstances 
(a) How the Party considers 
that its NDC is fair and 
ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
Grenada’s NDC is fair and ambitious.  The NDC target of 40% reduction by 2030 
on 2010 levels is consistent with the IPCC Special Report on the Impacts of 
Global Warming of 1.5°C.  
 
This special report shows pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot. Pathways that describe a 40-50 % reduction in net 
anthropogenic GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and net 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions reaching net zero around 2050.  
 
Grenada’s NDC is in line with the emissions pathways towards 2050 and 
onwards that correspond to keeping global warming in line with the global long- 
term goal of the Paris Agreement. 
(b)  Fairness considerations, 
including reflecting on 
equity; 
Please refer to 6(a) above. 
(c) How the Party has 
addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 3, of the Paris 
Agreement;  
The emissions reductions are a confirmation of the indicative ambitious 2030 
NDC target submitted in 2016. This target remains the highest possible ambition 
that Grenada can achieve for this NDC target year. In fact, due to changing and 
unforeseen circumstances, the 2030 target represents a more significant effort 
on the part of Grenada than when it was initially proposed. 
 
The achievement of the first NDC assumed that geothermal electricity would be 
available for the 2025 target. It is now clear that significant external support is 
required for the Geothermal programme for the 2030 target. Geothermal is 
currently the main contributor to Grenada’s mitigation efforts, however it is still in 
its exploratory phase. The existing feeder line network is believed to be able to 
incorporate a total of 15 MW of intermittent renewable energy. To meet the 2030 
target, Grenada will require a rapid transition, involving energy conservation 
mechanisms and renewable energy deployment. 
 
Vehicle sales have increased significantly than projected since the first NDC. In 
2018, the number of registered vehicles was 51% higher than in 2010. As a 
result, the measures proposed in the first NDC  for the transport sector 
(introduction of gasoline taxes, biofuel blends, and fuel efficiency standards) will 
be insufficient to achieve the 20% reductions anticipated from this sector by 
2025, much less to achieve further reductions by 2030  
 
While Grenada’s target is a base year target, and is not measured relative to 
future projections, these unforeseen factors will make it extremely difficult for the 
country to meet the targets set in 2016. As such, while Grenada will make every 
effort to meet the targets laid out in its NDC. It will not be feasible at this stage to 
commit to further emissions reductions beyond the 40% target.  
 
To support the implementation of the NDC, Grenada developed an NDC 
Partnership Plan with the support of the NDC Partnership. Grenada will embark 
on a process for developing an implementation plan, communications plan and 
financing strategy with concrete measures and timelines for  implementation to 
aid transition from NDC target to real action and emission reductions, with 
Page 15 of 15 
 
support as already indicated from the NDC Partnership, the UNDP Climate 
Promise and UNICEF.  
 
Grenada anticipates implementing the NDC through access to multilateral and 
bilateral support including through the Green Climate Fund, multilateral 
agencies, and bilateral arrangements with development partners. These funds 
will be used to leverage the limited national resources and technical capacities 
that are available for combatting climate change. 
The inclusion of F-gases and gender and youth considerations represent an 
expansion in scope relative to the first NDC. 
 
Grenada will also develop a long-term low emissions development strategy. 
(d) How the Party has 
addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 4, of the Paris 
Agreement; 
Please refer to 6(e) below. 
 
(e) How the Party has 
addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 6, of the Paris 
Agreement.  
Grenada has the option under the Paris Agreement to prepare and communicate 
strategies, plans, and actions for low greenhouse gas emissions development 
that reflects its special circumstances. Notwithstanding, from its initial NDC, 
Grenada has chosen to demonstrate its commitment to fighting climate change 
and making its contributions to reducing emissions in the context of the Paris 
Agreement, by submitting an economy-wide base year emissions reduction 
target. In this same spirit and in line with Article 4 paragraphs 3 and 4, 
Grenada’s second NDC remains an economy-wide base year target. 
7. How the NDC contributes towards achieving the objectives of the Convention as set out in 
its Article 2 
(a) How the NDC 
contributes towards 
achieving the objective of 
the Convention as set out in 
its Article 2;  
Grenada considers the ambitious nature of the NDC to be in line with Article 2 
of the convention. The NDC is an ambitious economy-wide target consistent with 
the best available science and based on the best available data. 
 
(b) How the NDC 
contributes towards Article 
2, paragraph 1(a), and 
Article 4, paragraph 1, of the 
Paris Agreement.  
Grenada considers the ambitious nature of the NDC to be in line with Article 2 
paragraph 1 (a) and Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Paris Agreement. The 
emissions reduction target in the NDC is consistent with the level of ambition 
required to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, 
as called for by the best available science and is also consistent with national 
efforts to achieve sustainable development and eradicate poverty.

GUYANA‟S REVISED 
INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 
  
Introduction 
  
People can build a future that is more prosperous, more just, and 
more secure. Our report, Our Common Future, is not a prediction of 
ever increasing environmental decay, poverty, and hardship in an 
ever more polluted world among ever decreasing resources. We see 
instead the possibility for a new era of economic growth, one that 
must be based on policies that sustain and expand the environmental 
resource base. And we believe such growth to be absolutely essential 
to relieve the great poverty that is deepening in much of the 
developing world. 
  
The hope for the future is conditional on decisive political action now 
to 
begin managing 
environmental 
resources 
to 
ensure 
both 
sustainable human progress and human survival. We are not 
forecasting a future; we are serving a notice - an urgent notice based 
on the latest and best scientific evidence - that the time has come to 
take the decisions needed to secure the resources to sustain this and 
coming generations. We do not offer a detailed blueprint for action, 
but instead a pathway by which the peoples of the world may enlarge 
their spheres of cooperation. 
  
Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development 
1987: Our Common Future, led by Norway’s Prime Minister Gro 
Bruntland with Sir Shridat S. Ramphal representing Guyana 
  
  
Notwithstanding the best efforts of many processes, the global community is once again 
severely challenged by the failure of the international system to act decisively to curb 
one of the main consequences of ignoring limits: climate change as a consequence of an 
increase in greenhouse gases resulting from human activity and industrial processes. 
  
2 
 
The Conference of the Parties (COP) that will be convened in Paris in December is one 
more attempt by the international system of the United Nations to convene 
governments, multilateral and bilateral agencies, the private sector, and NGOs and to 
engage citizens the world over. The goal is a binding agreement  to arrest the descent 
into a world where the increase in global temperatures by 2.7 – 3 degrees threatens the 
very existence of some states, importantly the small island and coastal low-lying 
developing states (SIDS), including Guyana. These states lack the capacity – financial 
and otherwise -  to withstand more frequent catastrophic climate events, if there is no 
agreement to reduce global emissions.  
  
The essential question in 2015 is the same as it was in 1987: Will  nations  continue a 
pattern of development that uses and abuses the Earth's resources in a manner that will 
guarantee the misery and destruction of countless millions, or to commit to a new 
pathway that will permit future generations to live in harmony with nature and each 
other?  
  
It is in this context, and in accordance with the Warsaw COP Decision 1/CP.19 and Lima 
1/CP.20 and the Guyana Constitution that  Guyana submits this revised Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC as our contribution to the global 
effort to combat climate change. 
  
Country profile 
Guyana has a long, proud history of forest conservation, with our indigenous peoples as 
the original stewards and conservators over their 7000-year-long legacy of wise use and 
accumulated traditional knowledge. Kaieteur National Park (est. 1929) was the first 
protected area in Amazonia. Sixty years later, in 1989, Guyana made a bold offer to the 
international community to share the responsibility to manage the pristine million-acre 
Iwokrama Rainforest “in a manner that will lead to lasting ecological, economic and 
social benefits to the people of Guyana and to the world in general”. Throughout our 
history, successive governments have contributed to national forest policy and the 
sustainable management of our state forests. In spite of some challenges, the Guyana 
Forestry Commission (GFC) and its predecessor, the Guyana Forestry Department, have 
been recognized for their professional management of the nation‟s 13.6 million hectare 
commercial forest patrimony. Because of this leadership and foresight, and with 
the  vigilance and related contributions of civil society advocates and organizations, 
Guyana has maintained one of the lowest deforestation rates on Earth (peaking at 
0.079% in 2012 and 0.065 % in 2014). 
  
3 
 
With the world‟s second highest percentage of rainforest cover (85%), Guyana 
commands globally important carbon stocks (19.5 GtCO2eq). As one of only a handful of 
countries that are net carbon sinks, Guyana‟s forests sequester more carbon than the 
nation‟s human activities generate. Guyana‟s 18.48 million forested hectares in total 
hold carbon in unusually high density (up to 350 tons/hectare), and store some 5.31 
gigatons of carbon. That amounts to approximately 6,638 tons/person, the second 
highest forest carbon stock per capita of any country on Earth.  
Between 2009 and 2015, with our partner the Kingdom of Norway, Guyana embarked 
on the world‟s first national-scale, payment-for-performance forest conservation 
agreement which provided financing for Guyana‟s innovative and pioneering Low 
Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS). This ground-breaking agreement established a 
model for the important contribution of high forest cover/low deforestation rate 
(HFLD) countries to the international fight to mitigate climate change. The viability of 
this REDD+ model relies on Guyana‟s highly-regarded national forest Measurement, 
Reporting and Verification System (MRVS). 
Guyana has led in the development of a nationwide MRVS and integrated Community 
MRV (CMRV) models. Through the Opt-in Mechanism, currently being developed, 
indigenous communities will have the opportunity to „Opt-in‟ to Guyana‟s REDD+ 
programme  through a consultative process that ensures community consensus based 
on FPIC principles and a benefit-sharing and governance framework,. 
Although rich in natural resources – including gold, diamonds, bauxite and timber – 
and with a population of less than 800,000, Guyana is classified as a lower-middle 
income developing country, and remains one of the poorest countries in South America 
and the Caribbean. 
Consequently, Guyana‟s enormous forest carbon stocks, together with other 
significant  ecosystems services - including abundant fresh water and biodiversity- make 
it the ideal country to continue to test and refine the economic viability of REDD+ 
payment schemes. Guyana is prepared to continue to sustainably manage, conserve, and 
protect this patrimony for the benefit of ourselves and all humanity. In return, we must 
obtain benefits to improve the wellbeing and quality of life of Guyanese. The economic 
and other benefits that can accrue from REDD+ and the Green Economy it supports 
need to be comparable with or superior to those obtainable from current extractive 
economic activities including artisanal gold mining, recognizing  that this activity 
supports the livelihoods of many thousands of Guyanese. 
Recalling Principal Seven of the Rio Declaration and UNFCCC‟s commitment 
to  “common but differentiated responsibility"", Guyana is offering to defer the pursuit of 
our historic natural resource exploitation-based economy, and offer our huge carbon 
stocks to the world if, in return, our sustainable human development needs and the cost 
of deferring business as usual are met by financial support from the international 
community in a predictable, just and equitable manner. 
4 
 
  
Common But Differentiated Responsibility has two matrices. The first is the common 
responsibility, which arises from the concept of common heritage and common 
concern of humankind, and reflects the duty of States to  equally share the burden of 
environmental protection for common resources; the second is the differentiated 
responsibility, which addresses substantive equality: unequal material, social and 
economic situations across States; different historical contributions to global 
environmental problems; and financial, technological and structural capacity to tackle 
those global problems. In this sense the principle establishes a conceptual framework 
for an equitable allocation of the costs of global environmental protection. 
  
In the delivery of all contributions, Guyana will be cognizant of, and respect, national 
and international commitments to human rights, including those of indigenous peoples 
and local communities and the needs and concerns of all other vulnerable groups.   
Guyana remains committed to the fight against global climate change and the success of 
COP21 in developing an international system that will effectively limit global 
temperature increase to  1.5C and make manifest the commitment of developed and 
developing nations to the agreed goal of common and differentiated responsibility for 
sustainable development. Therefore, in accordance with the Warsaw COP Decision 
1/CP.19 and Lima 1/CP.20, Guyana is pleased to submit this, our revised Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC. 
  
PLANNING PROCESS  
Guyana has employed a broadly consultative process to develop its intended nationally 
determined contributions through an Inter-Agency Task Force established by Cabinet. 
This Task Force oversaw the process of developing the submission. A small technical 
team, led by Guyana‟s lead negotiator, prepared the first draft, which was reviewed by 
the Task Force to produce a second draft. The second draft was presented at two public 
meetings in September 2015 – one for civil society in general and the second targeting 
representatives of indigenous organizations and communities. The third draft was 
approved by Cabinet and was submitted to the UNFCCC prior to October 1. 
Based on a second round of civil society review and inputs, an amended document was 
produced and presented at a national consultative conference, jointly coordinated by 
Government and Civil Society, at which a finalized consensus document was 
agreed.  This revised INDC was approved by Cabinet and submitted to the UNFCCC as 
Guyana‟s revised INDC. 
  
5 
 
Type of commitment 
While we look forward to broad-based and economically holistic emission reduction 
commitments from developed countries, the contribution of Guyana and other 
developing countries will in the main be policy-based including measures to reduce the 
normative ""business as usual"" growth in emissions. As a developing country, a coastal 
low-lying SIDS state, and  one of few net carbon sink countries, Guyana proposes the 
following policies, measures and actions, both conditional and unconditional. 
  
Coverage 
 Coverage is at the national level for the sectors covered in this INDC. 
Gases  
The greenhouse gas taken into account in this INDC is carbon dioxide.  
Sectors covered 
Guyana‟s intended contributions will focus on the forest and energy sectors, where the 
majority of our current and historic emissions are produced. 
While it is true that agriculture is a considerable source of other greenhouse gas 
(methane and nitrous oxide) emissions, and should be part of the general global 
mitigation agenda, for SIDS, LDCs and the African Group, domestic agriculture is 
critical to our food security and rural livelihoods. Agriculture in Guyana, as elsewhere, is 
under threat from the adverse effects of climate change, including floods and droughts. 
Given its small scale, and concentrated as it is along the narrow coastal strip where 
Guyana‟s most productive soils are found, our agriculture is particularly vulnerable to 
sea level rise and other adverse effects of climate change. Our contributions are 
therefore focused entirely on CO2 emissions and Guyana's agriculture is treated purely 
as an adaptation issue in this INDC. 
  
Time frame 
The time frame associated with Guyana‟s INDC is for the period up to 2025. 
 
Methodology/Metric 
Methodologies and metrics are consistent with IPCC guidance. 
6 
 
 
Use of land use and forestry sector 
Guyana will utilize a combination of conservation and sustainable management of its 
forests in the fight against climate change. 
 
Use of markets 
Outside our bilateral agreement with Norway, Guyana does not currently see viable 
opportunities in carbon trading markets; however this does not preclude participation 
in green consumer markets at all levels. Guyana‟s robust MRV system can ensure the 
integrity of our emission reduction efforts as we engage with carbon-neutral markets as 
a means of maximizing the value of our exports and providing internationally attractive, 
verifiable low carbon products. 
  
CONTRIBUTIONS 
Guyana‟s overarching contribution goal is to achieve a Green Economy via a low-
emission economic-development pathway. We intend to continue the transition of our 
economy to realize improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly 
reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. This includes the pursuit of a 
resilient, low-carbon, socially-inclusive economy that provides a better quality of life for 
all within the ecological limits of our planet, particularly as it pertains to our common 
global climate. 
Guyana‟s Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS) was first formulated in 2008. 
Implementation of the LCDS has been financed primarily with Guyana REDD+ 
Investment Fund (GRIF) resources earned under the Guyana Norway Agreement 
(GNA). With additional, timely, adequate and accessible resources, Guyana can build 
on this achievement and the lessons learned over the past five years to embark on a 
more inclusive and comprehensive path to a low-emission Green Economy. More 
specifically, with the provision of adequate resources, Guyana can increase its share of 
renewable energy by 100% by the year 2025. 
  
Our intended contributions are presented below. 
  
Forestry i)  Unconditional contributions 
Guyana is willing to continue making the following contributions unconditionally:  
7 
 
Continue and improve ongoing work to realize sustainable forest management. GFC 
will ensure compliance with the various Codes of Practice that govern the timber 
industry using local resources. 
Forest monitoring will maintain a high level of timber legality, with the GFC 
committing 50% of its staff to field monitoring from its 54 forest monitoring stations 
countrywide.  These efforts will maintain a low rate of illegal logging (at less than 2% of 
production). 
Guyana is also prepared to finalize and implement the Voluntary Partnership 
Agreement (VPA) under EU- FLEGT. The VPA is expected to be finalized in 2016 and to 
provide independent accreditation of forest legality and management practices 
throughout Guyana‟s timber industry. 
 We are prepared to improve added- value activities locally to assist in creating a 
higher potential for carbon storage in long-use wood products. This could also 
potentially reduce the pressure on forest resources as derivation of a higher value 
may result in reduced harvest levels. 
  
Indigenous people own and manage some 14% of Guyana‟s lands.  The culture and 
traditions of Guyana‟s indigenous peoples are rooted in sustainable use of nature, 
evident in the forests and other natural ecosystems maintained through centuries on 
the lands they have customarily occupied and used. Guyana will strengthen its 
support for indigenous communities as they continue the stewardship of their lands 
and inter alia the benefits that accrue from any REDD+ activities from these lands. 
If they choose to, communities will be supported to better manage their transition to 
more market-based means of provisioning for their social and cultural well-being in 
ways that continue the tradition of wise use. Indigenous peoples themselves, through 
the full application of the FPIC process, in keeping with the stated policy in the 
LCDS, will decide whether or not to include their titled lands as part of Guyana‟s 
REDD+ programme. Policies will also be implemented to reflect equity between the 
extractive sector and indigenous peoples as the nation moves to genuinely ensure 
that the fight against climate change continues. 
  
ii)       Conditional Contributions 
  
Avoided Deforestation 
Guyana‟s proposal for a Reference Level for REDD+ is based on the Combined 
Reference Level approach, in which a global forest carbon emissions loss of 0.44%, as 
concluded by Baccini et. al. 2012 is used, along with Guyana‟s historic emissions level 
for the period 2000 to 2009 (0.06%) as established in the GNA. Using a total carbon 
stock of forests in aboveground and belowground biomass of 19,197,411,268 tCO2e, 
Guyana‟s Proposed Reference Level for its REDD+ Programme is 48.7 MtCO2e. Through 
this approach, Guyana can continue to avoid emissions in the amount of 48.7 MtCO2e 
annually if adequate incentives are provided.  
8 
 
To contribute to avoided deforestation and achieve an effective REDD+ programme, 
Guyana will implement policies measures, and incentive programmes, to engender 
broader participation of civil society and the private sector in actions to avoid 
deforestation and forest degradation. The Guyana Government is cognizant of the need 
for comprehensive land use planning in order to efficiently management and rationally 
exploit our national resources.   
In summary, avoided emissions contributions resulting from reforms in the timber and 
mining industries can contribute up to 48.7 MtCO2e to the global mitigation effort 
through the implementation of the Emission Reduction Programme described in greater 
detail below. 
  
Emission Reduction Programme for Forests 
Given that the bulk of Guyana‟s emissions emanate from mining and logging activities, 
our Emissions Reductions Programme (ERP) will therefore focus on making these 
industries more efficient and compliant with our targets. With adequate resources, 
Guyana will develop a suite of ERP measures that will include: 
- the conservation of an additional 2 million hectares through Guyana‟s 
National Protected Area System and other effective area-based conservation 
measures as per Guyana‟s commitment under the UNCBD, including the 
protection of conservancies and reservoirs and their watersheds and the 
watersheds upstream of new hydro-power sites. Existing mangrove forests 
will be counted in this target and the mangrove restoration programme along 
the vulnerable coast will be expanded. 
  
Timber harvesting contributed 40% of Guyana‟s emissions from land use between 
2001 and 2012.   In the timber industry the ERP will: 
  
•       Use of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). Reducing the incidental and 
collateral damage during tree felling by about 10% and the damage from skid 
trails by about 35% (avoiding mid-size trees during skidding), could reduce the 
annual emissions by  13.5%. This translates to a reduction of about 430,000 
tCO2 per year. 
  
This will result in a reduction of the annual emissions from the timber industry 
from 3.5M tCO2 to 2.3M tCO2, a 20% reduction from historic levels for this 
driver, and an 11% reduction in the overall historic level. 
  
•       Guyana is in the process of reviewing compliance of significant timber 
concession agreements with a view to determining if they meet agreed targets. 
9 
 
A wider review to determine the most optimal use of these lands will be 
undertaken. If, in fact, REDD+ can provide adequate incentives, Guyana would 
be prepared to reduce the area to be logged in favour of conservation 
concessions and to further the development of non-timber forest products and 
other forest-based services while recognizing the need for livelihoods. 
  
Our MRVS has verified that small scale gold mining resulted in 89% of the deforestation 
recorded in Guyana over the past three years. To address this, the ERP will include 
actions by the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC) to implement policy 
reforms, education, and incentives for integrated planning and management of the 
mining sector. This will support the transformation of the mining sector by 2020 and 
include actions to: 
•       Implement mineral mapping in the mining districts to identify 
economically exploitable deposits. This will significantly reduce deforestation 
by avoiding clearing of forest cover from lands which contain only marginal 
mineral deposits. A significant portion of Guyana‟s deforestation results from 
forest clearing for mining that does not generate a profit. 
•       Implement awareness and incentive programmes to improve the 
efficiency of technologies and practices in the mining industry. This will 
include replacing inefficient mercury-based technology with more efficient 
technologies, such as shaker-tables and centrifuge systems that can increase 
gold recovery rates from 30% to 80%. Currently, low recovery rates cause 
miners to often return to previously mined areas when technology or 
economic circumstances favour them doing so. Improved recovery efficiency 
would make reprocessing of sites unnecessary and better facilitate cost-
effective reforestation and recovery of mined sites. 
•       Implement 
policies 
to 
institute 
mandatory, 
nation-wide 
land 
reclamation and reforestation of mined areas. 
   
Forest Governance 
Guyana has made significant progress in complying with EU-FLEGT for our timber 
exports to the European Union. Additional resources are required to build institutional 
and private sector capacity to meet other trade and supply conditions such as the Lacey 
Act, FSC certification and other procurement requirements. 
MRVS 
A comprehensive and robust MRV system, one of the most advanced of its kind, has 
been developed under Guyana‟s REDD+ programme. The development of this system 
has contributed considerably to the global understanding of how small forested tropical 
countries can reliably and cost-effectively measure and report on its forest carbon 
10 
 
emissions. Guyana is willing to build on the lessons learnt thus far to complete and 
maintain its MRVS if adequate financial resources are provided to do so. 
 Implementation cost 
The cost of implementation of these forest-conservation initiatives in total is estimated 
to be determined annually.  
 
Energy 
  
Unconditional Contributions 
Guyana is in the process of reviewing our options toward the rapid expansion of a 
renewable energy supply. Our goal is to develop a mix of wind, solar, biomass and 
hydropower to supply both the demand of the national grid and the energy 
requirements for towns and villages in Guyana‟s hinterland. 
Guyana will seek to construct and/or promote the construction of small hydro systems 
at suitable locations such as Moco Moco, Kato and Tumatumari. Guyana will power all 
of the six newly established townships, starting with Bartica, using renewable energy 
sources. Currently, Guyana has installed cogeneration from bagasse to power sugar 
mills. Independent power producers and suppliers are being encouraged to construct 
energy farms and sell energy to the national grid. Preliminary approvals have been given 
for a 26MW wind farm. 
The Government of Guyana will continue to work closely with farmers in agricultural 
areas across Guyana to encourage the use of bio-digesters to reduce waste, produce 
biogas and provide affordable, healthy and efficient cooking means at the household 
level. 
Legislation has been enacted to remove import duty and tax barriers for the importation 
of renewable energy equipment, compact fluorescent lamps and LED lamps to 
incentivize and motivate energy efficient behavior. Guyana will continue to conduct 
energy audits and replace inefficient lighting at public, residential and commercial 
buildings to reduce energy consumption. Public education and awareness programmes 
will continue to play a major role in providing consumers with information and tools to 
reduce energy consumption and expenditure. Guyana will implement other policies to 
encourage energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, including building codes 
and net-metering of residential renewable power. 
We expect that these unconditional contributions will significantly reduce Guyana‟s 
energy consumption.  
Conditional Contributions 
Guyana is committed to eliminating our near complete dependence on fossil fuels. 
Given our solar, wind and hydropower potential and relatively small national demand, 
11 
 
we believe that with adequate and timely financial support, Guyana can develop a 100% 
renewable power supply by 2025. Assessment of the potential of the renewable power 
sources will be undertaken to determine the most cost effective and efficient means of 
developing this potential; to this end an independent review of the Amaila Falls Project 
is to be undertaken with the assistance of the Kingdom of Norway. 
 
Assumptions and Risks 
 It is assumed that Guyana and Norway will agree to renew and extend our bilateral 
agreement. 
 It is further assumed the Green Climate Fund will be fully operationalized and begin 
disbursing from 2016. 
 It is also assumed that SIDS, and in particular coastal low-lying countries such as 
Guyana, will receive preferential access and special consideration in access to financing. 
 It is also assumed that REDD+ and renewable energy programmes and projects will be 
resourced in a predictable, adequate and timely manner. 
  
Fairness, Equity and Ambition 
Guyana is a highly vulnerable developing country within SIDS. Guyana‟s aggregate 
emissions in 2004[1] were 0.004617GtCO2eq, representing one hundredth of one per 
cent of the world total emissions for that year. This, paired with the carbon 
sequestration of our 18.48 million hectares of natural forests and our extremely low 
historic deforestation rates (0.06%) makes Guyana one of the world‟s few net carbon 
sink countries. Given our status as a net carbon sink, and a lower-middle-income 
developing state our proposed contributions to the fight against climate change is fair, 
equitable, and ambitious. 
  
Adaptation 
See Annex 1 
  
Means of Implementation 
 Implementation of Guyana‟s iNDC is estimated at US$ (to be determined) divided 
between the forestry, energy, and adaptation activities (shown in the Annex). 
  
 
 
  
12 
 
 
ANNEX 1 - ADAPTATION 
Contributions 
  
Unconditional contributions 
  
With its limited resources, Guyana will continue basic work on integrated water 
management infrastructure, which includes the construction, rehabilitation and 
maintenance of conservancies and canals, and sea defenses, water supply and 
sanitation, as well as the introduction of new agricultural techniques such as 
hydroponics and fertigation. Climate change considerations will be mainstreamed in all 
sectors of national development. 
  
The GoG is currently in the process of preparing a Climate Resilience Strategy and 
Action Plan (CRSAP) which is expected to provide a comprehensive framework for 
adaptation and resilience building in Guyana. Guyana will continue and finalize its work 
on the CRSAP, but will require significant resources to implement it. 
  
Conditional contributions 
  
Given the requisite support, Guyana will undertake actions in the following areas: 
•       Implementation of the CRSAP. 
•       Upgrading infrastructure and other assets to protect against flooding. 
•       Mangrove restoration. 
•       Hinterland Adaptation Measures. 
•       Development and implementation of Early Warning Systems. 
•       Enhanced weather forecasting including microclimate studies and localized 
forecasting. 
•       Development and introduction of crop varieties which are: 
o   Flood resistant, 
13 
 
o   Drought tolerant, 
o   Disease resistant. 
•       Develop environmental and  climate change awareness programmes at all 
levels. 
•       Developing innovative financial risk management and insurance measures. 
  
Means of Implementation  
In order to implement its conditional adaptation actions, including infrastructural 
development works, Guyana will require an estimated US$ 1.6 Billion in the period to 
2025.

May 2023
1. Introduction
The Holy See and the Vatican City State are committed to promoting sustainable development
through environmental policies to safeguard our common home, as well as through initiatives in
favour of an integral ecology education aimed at stimulating new lifestyles, based on sustainability,
fraternity and the covenant between the human person and the environment.
On 24 May 2015, Pope Francis issued his Encyclical Letter Laudato Si’ on Care for Our
Common Home,1 in which he noted that the «challenge to protect our common home includes a
concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for
we know that things can change».2 He urgently appealed «for a new dialogue about how we are
shaping the future of our planet».3
Later, on 12 December 2020, in a Video-Message to the High Level Virtual Climate Ambition
Summit, Pope Francis underscored that a strategy is necessary to reduce net emissions to zero (net-
zero emission), and announced that the Holy See intended to join others in this effort by taking action
at two different levels:
1. «On the one hand, Vatican City State is committed to reducing net emissions to zero before 2050,
intensifying efforts at environmental management that have already been in process for some
years, and which make possible the rational use of natural resources such as water and energy,
energy efficiency, sustainable mobility, reforestation, and the circular economy also in waste
management.
2. On the other, the Holy See is committed to promoting education in integral ecology. Political and
technical measures must be united with an educational process that favours a cultural model of
development and sustainability based on fraternity and the alliance between human beings and the
environment».4
On 04 October 2022, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement entered into force for the Vatican City State, as a non-Annex I
Party. By acceding to both the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement on behalf of Vatican City State,
the Holy See expressed its intention «to contribute and to give its moral support to the efforts of all
States to cooperate, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective
capabilities, in an effective and appropriate response to the challenges posed by climate change to
humanity and to our common home»5.

5 Declaration annexed to the Instrument of Accession of the Holy See, acting in the name and on behalf of Vatican City
State, to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to the Paris Agreement, 4 July 2022.
1Such challenges have «not only environmental, but also ethical, social, economic and political
relevance, affect[ing] above all the life of the poorest and most fragile. In this way they appeal to our
responsibility to promote, through collective and joint commitment, a culture of care, which places
human dignity and the common good at the centre»6. By answering the question «What kind of world
do we want to leave to those who come after us, to children who are now growing up?»7, the Holy
See and the Vatican City State wish that the Convention and the Paris Agreement would help to
promote «a remarkable convergence on the urgent need for a change of direction, a decisive resolve
to pass from the “throwaway culture” prevalent in our societies to a “culture of care” for our common
home and its inhabitants, now and in the future […]. Humanity possesses the wherewithal to effect
this change, which calls for a genuine conversion, individual as well as communitarian, and a decisive
will to set out on this path. It will entail the transition towards a more integral and integrating model
of development, based on solidarity and on responsibility».8 These two core-values are at the basis of
the implementation of both the Convention and the Paris Agreement, and will guide the efforts of the
Holy See and the Vatican City State in this process.
The Holy See also ratified, in the name and on behalf of the Vatican City State, the Vienna
Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete
the Ozone Layer with its first four Amendments in 2008, as well as its Kigali Amendment in 2020.
By communicating herewith its National Determined Contribution (NDC) as requested by
Article 3 and Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, the Vatican City State commits itself to
reduce greenhouse gases to 20% below 2011 level by 2030.
Reduction target Base year Time-frame
20% 2011 2022-2030
2. National circumstances
The Vatican City State is the smallest sovereign State in the world, both in terms of population
and territory, consisting of 0.44 square kilometers, and is an enclave surrounded by the territory of
the Italian Republic.
The climate in Vatican City State is temperate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers.
The average annual rainfall, around 750 mm and distributed on average over 79 days, with its
minimum peak in summer and an accentuated peak in autumn.
The Vatican City State should not be confused with the Holy See. The Holy See is a sovereign
subject of international law possessing full international legal personality. Although it is not territorial
in nature, it enjoys the same rights and obligations as other States and it is independent from any
territorial authority or jurisdiction, although at present it exercises sovereignty over Vatican City
State. Moreover, the Holy See does not exercise jurisdiction, as that term is understood in
international law, over individual Catholics and institutions located outside the territory of Vatican
City State. Each member of the Catholic Church is subject to the laws of the respective State in which
he or she lives. Therefore, when the Holy See ratified, in the name and on behalf of the Vatican City
State, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, it
undertook to observe its provisions exclusively within the Territory of the Vatican City State, as
circumscribed by the Leonine Walls.9

8 Pope Francis Message to UNFCCC’s COP26, 29 October 2021.
9 Cfr. Declaration annexed to the Instrument of Accession to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change and to the Paris Agreement, 4 July 2022.
2To date, there are 421 people residing in the territory of Vatican City State. While the number
of the residents is not statistically significant, goods and services in the Vatican City State are
provided mostly to a large number of non-residents. In addition to residents and citizens who reside
there permanently for reasons of work, access is allowed to other people who are not citizens or do
not have residence in the State. The transient population of the State is approximately 6.000 people,
to which it must be added those (family members, pensioners, beneficiaries of the Health Fund and
professional collaborators) who use the goods and services provided by the State.
Unlike other States, the Vatican City State does not have its own productive sector. Due to its
peculiar nature, there is no “gross value” of the economic activities carried out within it. Its national
income is essentially made up of asset management and the income generated by services provided
and goods sold to residents, citizens and others.
Energy use in Vatican City State depends almost entirely on energy imports, as the State has
neither fossil fuel sources, nor energy production plants with the exception of a negligible amount of
energy produced from renewable sources.
3. National Determined Contribution (NDC)
The Vatican City State commits itself to reduce greenhouse gases to 20% below 2011 level
by 2030.
3.1 Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding
 Base year
Vatican City State’s NDC objectives will be benchmarked at the year 2011.
 Emissions equivalent to CO in base year
2
In 2011, CO emissions reached a value of almost 18,94 kt (this is a provisional figure,
2eq
which will be better defined through further data collection) and are broken down as shown in the
table below.

n.d.
Total 18.935,07
 Objective of CO emissions reduction
2eq
By 2030, emissions will be reduced by 20% of the 2011 figure.
 Assumptions and Methodological Approach
The methodological approaches used to estimate and account for anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emissions and their abatement employ standard methods. More specifically, Vatican emissions
were calculated using the standard methods and procedures employed by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories as adopted by the UNFCCC and using common metrics as
3agreed in the Paris Agreement considering the Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in
accordance with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. The LULUCF sector will be accounted on a land-
based approach.
 Time frames
The indicated reduction target will be met by the end of the year 2030 through the adoption
of a strategy employing a progressive commitment over the indicated period.
 Scope and coverage
 Absolute economy-wide emission reduction target compared with a base year.
 Geographical scope: Vatican city.
 Controlled substances: all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol (CO ,
2
CH , N O, HFC).
4 2
 Sectors involved: energy, and in particular district heating, and transportation, industrial
processes and product use, land use, land use change and forestry.
The Vatican City State intends to achieve its national emission reduction targets through
national measures. However, if domestic reductions prove insufficient to achieve the set objectives
the use of international mechanisms will not be excluded.
4. Planning process, fairness and ambition:
The Vatican’s planning processes includes the sectors mentioned in paragraph 3.1.
Several environmental management projects have been planned and implemented within the
Vatican City State, each carried out in accordance with the guidelines laid out in Laudato Si’. The
aim of these projects has been to reduce energy consumption, optimize the management of water
resources, reduce emissions of substances harmful to global warming and the ozone layer, manage
waste production in a sustainable manner, and encourage recovery and recycling.10
The Encyclical Letter Laudato Si’ on Care for Our Common Home remains the main reference
text for the Vatican City State in the implementation of its NDCs and in the promotion of the related
education and awareness activities.
The principles and guidelines indicated have led and will lead the Vatican to the development
of additional projects aimed at promoting:
 rational use of natural resources (water and energy);
 energy efficiency and the improvement of the State’s technological assets;
 sustainable mobility;
 diversification and supply of less polluting or alternative energy products for motor vehicles;
 waste disposal;
 development of reforestation projects.
It should be stressed, nonetheless, that margins for further improvements are minimal when
considering the small size of its territory and the fact that Vatican City State has already moved
decidedly in the direction of sustainability in the recent past, encouraging mitigation and increasing
its energy efficiency.
10 Cfr. Interdicasterial Working Group of the Holy See on Integral Ecology, Journeying towards Care for Our Common
Home. Five Years after Laudato Si’. Rome: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 31 May 2020, pp. 211-215.
4Nevertheless, these policies will continue to advance in the coming years, focusing on the
coordination of climate-relevant measures within the Vatican’s current approach to energy, transport
and environmental policy. This will allow for:
 addressing the regulation of energy and environmental factors, increasing energy efficiency, the
diversification of sources and the adoption of low environmental impact technologies;
 disseminating greater education and awareness related to environmental protection and integral
ecology;
 valuing global and synergistic action that is both comprehensive and ambitious in favor of the
climate;
 accelerating the energy transition, innovation and technological development in the productive
sectors with the greatest negative externalities.
Even if the State’s contribution to global emissions in 2022 is around 0,0000443%, the
Vatican City State is committed to achieving a reduction in emissions in line with the goal of keeping
global warming below 2°C, as well as to pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C
above pre-industrial levels as foreseen in the Art. 2 of Paris Agreements.
Although the Vatican City State contributes to global emissions in an insignificant way, it
considers it essential to invest in quality emission reduction projects as well as in integral ecology
education initiatives, which, in addition to the mitigation of greenhouse gases, also lead to ethical and
social benefits.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its

Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%,

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of the Nationally Determined Contribution of 
Iceland 
 
Communicated to the UNFCCC on February 18, 2021 
 
This submission consists of four parts: 1) the Introduction, 2) Iceland’s updated and 
enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 3) Annex I, with the information 
provided to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of the NDC and 4) 
Annex II, with additional information to clarify Iceland’s climate profile, policies and legal 
arrangements, including information on the government pledge for Iceland to become 
carbon neutral by 2040. 
 
1) Introduction 
With this submission, Iceland updates its NDC by enhancing its commitment to at least 55 
per cent net greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990, to be achieved 
by acting jointly with the European Union and its Member States and Norway.   
Iceland submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) in 2015, which 
became its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) upon Iceland’s ratification of the Paris 
Agreement, on 24 September 2016. There, Iceland announced its intention of being part of a 
collective delivery by European countries to reach a target of 40 per cent reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.  
In October 2019, an agreement was finalized on climate cooperation between Iceland, Norway 
and the EU, with the Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 269/2019, which amended 
Protocol 31 to the EEA Agreement.1  Iceland intends to fulfil its enhanced NDC of at least 55 
per cent net greenhouse gas emissions within the framework of the agreement which is 
subject to revision in light of the enhanced target. Iceland, along with Norway, will work with 
the European Union and its Member States in reviewing the relevant provisions of their 2019 
agreement, as needed, on climate cooperation to reflect the enhanced emissions target for 
2030.  
Based on the EEA Joint Committee Decision No 269/2019, Iceland takes part in three key 
climate mitigation legislative frameworks: Emissions Trading System (ETS), which inter alia 
includes emissions from the heavy industry and aviation sectors in Iceland; Effort Sharing 
Regulation, which sets binding targets for non-ETS emissions for individual targets; and 
LULUCF, which covers emissions and carbon removals from the Land Use, Land Use Change

and Forestry sector. This means that Iceland’s contribution towards the joint fulfilment target 
is comparable in effort and governed by the same set of rules as for the Member States of 
the European Union and for Norway.  
Iceland announced on 12 December 2020 at the Climate Ambition Summit that Iceland would 
increase its level of ambition from the currently pledged 40 per cent emissions cuts to 2030, 
to 55 per cent or more, acting jointly to achieve this enhanced target with other European 
States. The European Union and its Member States have since communicated that they, 
acting jointly, are committed to a binding target of a net domestic emission reduction of at 
least 55 per cent to 2030 compared to 1990. Iceland’s enhanced ambition target of 55 per 
cent net emissions reduction refers to the joint target of the countries involved; the 
individual share and commitments of each country is then determined by commonly agreed 
rules. 
 
2) Iceland‘s Nationally Determined Contribution 
 
Iceland‘s Nationally Determined Contribution 
Iceland is committed to a target of 55 per cent net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2030 compared to 1990, acting jointly with the European Union and its Member States and

Planning processes 
(a) 
Information on the planning processes that the Party 
undertook to prepare its nationally determined contribution 
and, if available, on Party´s implementation plans, including, as 
appropriate: 
 
Iceland announced on 12 December 2020 at the Climate Ambition 
Summit that Iceland would increase its level of ambition from the 
currently pledged 40 per cent emissions cuts to 2030, to 55 per cent or 
more, acting jointly to achieve this enhanced target with other European 
States.   
 
The Government took a formal decision on the enhanced target at its 
meeting on 4 December 2020.   
 
The 
Parliament´s 
Standing 
Committee 
for 
Environment 
and 
Communication was consulted in the planning process before the 
announcement on 12 December 2020. 
 
An updated Climate Action Plan was published in June 2020, with 48 
mitigation actions in different sectors aiming to meet the commitments 
on net emissions reduction. The Action Plan specifically states that it is 
intended to achieve more net emissions reductions than are strictly 
required by Iceland’s current international commitments, before the 
formal announcement of enhanced ambition on 12 December 2020.  
 
The work on the Climate Action Plan was carried out by an inter-
ministerial working-group, with the Association of Local Authorities also 
represented, led by the Ministry for the Environment and Natural 
Resources.  
(i) 
Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and 
engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, 
in a gender-responsive manner; 
The Climate Action Plan, published in 2020, reflects comments and 
suggestions received during public hearing as well as conclusions of a 
consultation process with stakeholders and civil society. 
 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
 
 
 
Institutional arrangements:  
Through the climate cooperation with the European Union and Norway, 
specific regulation has been implemented, covering all emission and 
sectors (see 3(a)). 
 
The Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources has the 
overarching cross-sectoral responsibility for coordination and 
implementation, whereas different ministries are responsible for 
actions that falls under their respective sectors. The Ministry for 
Finance is responsible for tax schemes.    
The coordination is carried out by inter-ministerial working-group, 
where the Association of Local Authorities is also represented, led 
by the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources. 
 
With an amendment made to the Climate Act No 70/2012 in 2019, the 
administration 
framework 
regarding 
climate 
issues 
was 
strengthened. The Act prescribes clear directions on arrangements 
for the work on the Climate Action Plan and how it should be updated 
and reviewed on; a framework on adaptation to climate change is 
established, and guidelines set regarding the scientific reporting on 
the impact of climate change on Iceland.  
 
A legal base was established for the Climate Council with the 
amendment to the Icelandic Climate Act in 2019. Members of the 
Climate Council are appointed for four years at a time. The Climate 
Council is an independent body whose role is to hold authorities 
accountable and provide advice on policy objectives and specific 
measures related to climate change. 
 
In 2011, Iceland ratified the UNECE Convention on Access to 
Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to 
Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention), which 
links human rights and environmental rights.

(a) Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party´s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
Current approach is in accordance with methodologies and common 
metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5 (d), below).   
It is foreseen that, at the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be 
in accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1

(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for the implementation of policies and measures or 
strategies in the nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable.  
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into 
account existing methods and guidance under the Convention 
to account for anthropogenic emissions and removals, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 14, of the Paris 
Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5(d) below 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
 
Metrics:  Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance with 
IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, 
methodologies and approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, 
as appropriate, including, as applicable: 
Information in Section 5(e)(i-iii) and 5(f)(i) refers to the legal framework in 
force at the time of this submission. This is subject to revision in light of 
the enhanced target. Iceland´s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC 
guidance, TACCC principles and existing accounting rules, updating and 
improving them for the period from 2021 to 2030. The framework identifies 
net accounted emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of 
enhancing Iceland´s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals 
from natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 sets out provision for 
natural disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land. 
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from 
harvested wood products; 
Production Approach is used to account for emissions and removals from 
harvested wood products, as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see also Art 9 and 
Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in 
forests; 
Within the context of Iceland’s climate cooperation with the European 
Union and Norway, emissions and removals in managed forests in the 
period 2021-2030 will be accounted for as the deviation from a projected 
forward-looking forest reference level, with regards to dynamic age-related 
forest characteristics, as in accordance with Art 8 and Annex IV of 
Regulation (EU) 2018/841.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
Projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest Land remaining 
Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of forest so that 
changes in management practices are accounted; see also Art 8 and Annex 
IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841. 
(f) 
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
N/A 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference 
level(s), including, where applicable, sector-, category- or 
activity-specific reference levels, are constructed, including, for 
example, key parameters, assumptions, definitions, 
methodologies, data sources and models used; 
The following information in this section is subject to revision in light of 
the enhanced target. The elements of the approach have been developed 
in accordance with IPCC 2006 guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent 
with decision 18/CMA.1  
Accounting for emissions and removals from LULUCF follows specific rules 
depending on the land accounting category in accordance with Regulation 
(EU) 2018/841.  
Afforested Land and Deforested Land use baseline zero (gross-net 
accounting). Managed Grassland, Managed Cropland and Managed Wetland 
use as baseline the average emissions between 2005 and 2009 (net-net 
accounting). 
Managed Forest Land uses as baseline a Forest Reference Level based on 
continuation of Forest Management Practices between 2000 and 2009 and 
taking into account the age-class structure of forests, projected through 
the compliance period.  
The mere presence of carbon stocks is excluded from accounting. LULUCF 
Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported categories of 
forest land, cropland, grassland, and wetland, including land use change 
between these categories, and between these categories and settlements 
and other land. LULUCF Pools: Above-ground biomass; Below-ground 
biomass; Litter; Dead wood; Soil organic carbon; Harvested wood products.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances; 
 
Iceland´s updated NDC represents a significant increase in ambition 
beyond its initial NDC submitted at the time of ratifying the Paris 
Agreement. Both the initial NDC and this update require significantly 
higher net emissions reductions than were projected as business as usual 
at the time of their adoption. 
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
Iceland regards its nationally determined contribution to represent its fair 
share of the efforts to achieve the global long-term goal of the Paris 
Agreement. 
 
The IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C shows that pathways 
limiting warming to 1.5°C typically achieve net zero greenhouse gas 
emissions at global level in the second half of this century. This enhanced 
NDC is in line with Iceland´s intention of achieving a climate-neutrality 
2040. Iceland therefore considers the enhanced NDC to be a fair 
contribution towards the global temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.

Paris Agreement; 
This updated NDC Iceland represents a progression of ambition for Iceland 
compared to both its 2020 commitment and its initial NDC submission. See

Additional information on climate change mitigation and adaptation in Iceland 
Iceland’s anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to almost 4.9 million 
tons in 2018, without LULUCF. The main sources of emissions are: Industrial processes 
(42%), burning of fossil fuels, mostly in road transport and fisheries (37%), agriculture (13%) 
and waste management (6%). Stationary energy – electricity production and heating – is 
produced almost 100% from renewable resources, hydro and geothermal. Some emissions 
of CO2 in geothermal steam are attributed to geothermal energy production (3% of total 
emissions), while such emissions are much smaller than from energy production from fossil 
fuels. 
 
LULUCF 
The general impacts of land use activities are well understood, and LULUCF is a priority in 
Iceland´s Climate Action Plan. The government supports sustainable land use practices, and 
nature-based solutions such as restoration of woodlands, wetlands and other native 
ecosystems in addition to afforestation and revegetation practices. Also, the government 
discourages further wetlands draining and unsustainable land use practices. Iceland 
provides only partial information in LULUCF accounting to the Convention, as sufficient 
knowledge on carbon budgets for all land types is not available. Efforts are under way to 
improve LULUCF accounting and strengthen its scientific underpinnings, to ensure that 
Iceland fulfils the requirements of the EU LULUCF Regulation No 2018/841. 
There are significant reported and estimated emissions in the LULUCF sector, mostly legacy 
emissions from wetlands drained in the 20th Century. These emissions can be reduced or 
halted by reclamation of drained wetlands. Iceland also has great potential for carbon 
uptake by reforestation, revegetation and afforestation; actions that actively reverse 
historical soil erosion and loss of woodlands. As for LULUCF activities, Iceland has 
developed good accounting for afforestation and other activities related to forests, as well 
as revegetation, but less robust accounting for wetlands draining and reclamation and 
other activities.  
 
Mitigation 
Iceland’s main instrument for climate mitigation is the Climate Action Plan. The present 
plan was presented in 2018, and thoroughly revised in 2020. The plan outlines 48 actions 
across all relevant sectors intended to help Iceland meet its Paris Agreement targets for 
2030 and reach the government’s aim to make Iceland carbon neutral before 2040. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 
 
Adaptation 
Iceland has prioritized mitigation, in order to limit net greenhouse gas emissions to reach 
the Paris Agreement’s target of holding the increase in the global average temperature well 
below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the 
temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. However, adaptation measures will also be needed, 
in order to tackle the unavoidable impacts that will accompany higher temperatures and 
associated changes. Impacts of climate change on Iceland include receding glaciers, 
expanding woodlands, changes in sea level (higher levels in some parts, but lower in other), 
warming seas with changes in species distributions, and increased risks of many types of 
natural disasters. Of particular concern is ocean acidification and its possible impact on 
marine life and fisheries. Work is currently under way for a national adaptation strategy 
due to be finalized in 2021. 
 
Carbon Neutrality in 2040 
The goal of carbon neutrality is to be reached by cutting emissions in all sectors, and by 
increasing carbon removals from the atmosphere, including by restoration, revegetation, 
afforestation, and carbon capture and mineralization in rock formations (Carbfix). Efforts 
are currently under way in all these categories, which need to be strengthened for Iceland 
to reach carbon neutrality in 2040 and a state of negative net emissions after that. Robust 
carbon accounting methods are also available for these activities, which will help Iceland 
keeping track of progress towards the goal. Carbon accounting and reporting in the LULUCF 
sector in general needs to be improved, as is discussed above.  
A new project outlining pathways towards carbon neutrality is currently being launched 
and will include consultations with stakeholders and the public. It can be guided by 
currently available accounting methods for carbon removals, but it is foreseen that the 
accounting framework for the carbon neutrality goal will be revised in a few years' time, 
when a more robust LULUCF accounting framework will be in place in Iceland.   
Iceland is currently working on its long-term low greenhouse gas emission development 
strategy, in accordance with Art. 4, Para.19, of the Paris Agreement. The project on pathways 
towards carbon neutrality is seen as providing needed information for the strategy, which 
is planned to be submitted this year.

INDIA’S UPDATED FIRST NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION 
WORKING TOWARDS CLIMATE JUSTICE 
 
Pursuant to decision 1/CP.20, India submitted its Intended Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) on 2nd October, 2015. In accordance with decision 1/CP.21, 
paragraph 22, India’s Intended NDC is now its first NDC under the Paris 
Agreement. 
 
The Article 4, paragraph 9 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party shall 
communicate a nationally determined contribution every five years in accordance 
with decision 1/CP.21. Decision 1/CP.21, paragraphs 23 and 24, requests Parties 
to communicate or update this contribution and to do so every five years, pursuant 
to Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Agreement.  
 
Therefore, in accordance with the aforesaid provision of the Paris Agreement read 
with relevant decisions, India hereby communicates an update to its first NDC 
submitted earlier on October 2, 2015, for the period up to 2030, as under:

2005 level [UPDATED].   
 
4. To achieve about 50 percent cumulative electric power installed 
capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, with 
the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance 
including from Green Climate Fund (GCF) [UPDATED].  
 
5. To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 
equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. 
 
6. To better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in 
development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, 
particularly agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal 
regions, health and disaster management. 
 
7. To mobilize domestic and new & additional funds from developed 
countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in 
view of the resource required and the resource gap. 
 
8. To build capacities, create domestic framework and international 
architecture for quick diffusion of cutting edge climate technology in India 
and for joint collaborative R&D for such future technologies.

  Executive Summary 
   This document is a voluntary national contribution and a vision that represents 
Iraq's highest policy in dealing with the issue of climate change nationally and 
internationally. This document comes in response to the Paris Agreement adopted at 
the 21st Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC). 
   As a developing country, Iraq believes that solutions to climate change can only be 
achieved with the active participation of all countries and within the principles of the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, based on 
common but differentiated responsibility according to national circumstances and capabilities 
and historical responsibility for the occurrence of this issue. 
   Since its early accession to the UNFCCC, Iraq started working on implementing many 
projects and studies aimed at adapting to the effects of climate change and mitigating 
emissions, but most of these projects have been completely halted as a result of the fierce 
confrontation with ISIS terrorist gangs, which caused catastrophic consequences that affected 
all sectors of life, threatened security and social peace, completely destroyed infrastructure 
and displaced hundreds of thousands of people, in addition to the damage to the economic 
sector already affected by the fluctuation and decline in oil prices and the terrorist 
organisation's control over several oil wells and oil and industrial installations and forced the 
   The impact of climate change on Iraq has been evident in the significant decrease in its 
water resources and the increasing rise in temperature rates in excess of global averages. 
However, Iraq presents this ambitious plan in which all national plans and strategies related 
to climate change have been adopted to be compatible with the national development needs 
and orientations of all sectors to ensure the achievement of the desired goals nationally and 
internationally in making gradual qualitative and radical transformations according to the 
available national capabilities if security and peace are achieved and economic resources are 
provided to ensure a decent life for the Iraqi people

Chapter One 
 
National circumstances and possibilities: 
 
   Iraq is located in southwest Asia within the arid and semi-arid regions, and has acquired 
from this location its semi-continental climate influenced by the Mediterranean climate, 
where Iraq's climate is characterised by a wide daily and annual thermal range, due to the 
lack of large bodies of water that reduce the cold of winter and the heat of summer, and the 
lack of rainfall in the direction from the northeast to the southwest, and due to this 
geographical location it is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of 
global warming and climate change in its multiple dimensions. 
   Iraq's population is estimated at more than 40 million, with an annual growth rate of 
2.However, Iraq's economy and business as usual has not been at the required level that meets 
the needs of the Iraqi citizen, as it has been clearly fluctuating and has fallen for a long time 
to low levels due to the exceptional circumstances of wars, conflicts and economic blockade 
during and after the previous regime and the huge numbers of displaced and displaced people 
due to its exposure to ISIS terrorist attacks, and it is difficult for the annual Iraqi national 
budget to provide the necessary funds for reconstruction and the return of displaced and 
displaced people to their homes, as the terrorist organisation ISIS and the war it launched on 
Iraq caused serious damage to the infrastructure and infrastructure of the country. However, 
despite this, Iraq supports the global trend and the paths set by the Paris Agreement, which 
aims to preserve the planet and calls on developed and major industrialised countries to 
commit to mitigation promises and provide financial and technical support, technology 
transfer and transparent implementation towards developing countries to help them 
implement their national contributions and achieve sustainable development goals within 
their territories and enable them to survive by establishing a diversified and flexible economy 
that is responsive to current and future climate changes, so Iraq's desire is strong towards 
rebuilding destroyed cities according to modern building systems to become green, 
sustainable cities, which has had a direct impact on the country's ability to rebuild its cities. 
This has directly affected the country's ability to enable many national sectors to recover and 
face the risks of climate change, especially since most of the available resources have been 
diverted towards the health sector to prevent it from collapsing as a result of the Corona 
pandemic and the major health issues that have placed a great burden on this important 
sector, and the economic situation is still unclear and unpredictable 
   Iraq has natural ecosystems rich in biodiversity, but its geographical location within arid 
and semi-arid regions has made it one of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of global 
climate change, as evidenced by unprecedented climatic phenomena such as low rainfall 
rates, low water levels in lakes and rivers, unprecedented temperature rises of more than 
double the global average, fires, increased dust storms in their intensity, frequency and time 
periods, and increased desertification, which caused pressure on ecosystems and the balances 
4 
 
that they create, which contributed to the reduction in the spread of many endemic plant 
species and the decrease in the number of wild animals or their extinction as a result of 
climate change. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 
this is considered a direct threat in terms of severity to ecosystems and biodiversity, but 
despite these pressures, large areas of Iraq are still of global and local importance, for 
example the marsh areas, which have been included on the World Heritage List because of 
their importance, in addition to the declaration of many protected areas with their natural 
richness and the environmental services they provide with an important economic return. 
 
   Surface water is the main water resource in Iraq, consisting of the waters of the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers and their tributaries and the Shatt al-Arab. There has been a significant 
decrease in Iraq's water resources due to the many dams and irrigation and development 
projects established on these rivers in neighbouring countries to secure their water shares and 
use them to generate hydroelectric power, which has affected Iraq's water share and quality, 
and the effects of climate change have caused a decrease in the amount of water coming into 
its rivers, as the water sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors in the face of climate 
change. 
Although our country's coastline on the Arabian Gulf is very narrow, the rising sea level 
could threaten the southern region with drowning, especially Basra Governorate, which 
overlooks the Gulf and where Iraq's economic capacity is concentrated. In addition, the rising 
temperature and acidity of these waters affects the biodiversity of the marine environment 
and coral reefs in Iraq's territorial waters and also affects the tourism aspect in this area, so 
this issue is of exceptional importance in dealing with this issue. 
   The agricultural sector is one of the most water-consuming sectors in Iraq (about 35 billion 
cubic metres/year), where the percentage of water consumption in this sector accounts for 
85%. Due to the use of open and old irrigation channels, fragile or weak water resources 
management, dilapidated infrastructure, the use of old irrigation techniques (surface 
irrigation) for some crops such as rice and traditional farming patterns, the amounts of 
irrigation water exceeded the specified water quotas, which led over time to high water levels 
and soil salinisation. 
   The transport sector is an important sector in the economy of any country, and all economic 
and life activities such as shopping, housing and entertainment cannot perform their role and 
function without linking to transport lines due to the impact of other economic sectors such as 
industry, trade and tourism, and this sector suffers from poor infrastructure, which is the main 
pillar of transport development due to the lack of laws, legislation and projects that support 
the trend towards sustainable, collective and environmentally friendly means of transport.  
   Iraq suffers from a severe weakness in the infrastructure supporting the industrial sector due 
to the lack of cities and industrial zones that provide the necessary infrastructure for the 
establishment of various industries, in addition to the weakness of the support structure for 
industry and investment, which contributed to the deterioration of this sector. The weakness 
of the comprehensive knowledge infrastructure of communications and information 
technology networks, as well as the infrastructure of standards, metrics and quality, and the 
weak efforts to support the private sector to become a key partner in economic development 
5 
 
through clear and sophisticated programmes, all of which have clearly and tangibly affected 
the reality of the industrial sector and its inability to keep pace with the global march of 
progress. 
 
Environmental laws and legislation: 
The Iraqi state, especially after 2003, issued many legislations aimed at protecting the 
environment, but the country's security conditions did not help in fully implementing them, 
and there is a need for other legislations and modernising the existing ones to be in line with 
the requirements of confronting climate change. 
Environmental awareness: 
   Environmental awareness is the generalisation and deepening of environmental knowledge 
among all segments and groups of society through appropriate environmental means and 
messages, and motivating them to contribute and participate individually and collectively in 
protecting the environment and preserving its resources. Since climate change is the issue of 
the age and women and children are more vulnerable than men to climate change, it is 
necessary to raise full environmental awareness about climate change and develop strategies, 
plans, laws and legislation to raise environmental awareness among all segments of society, 
especially vulnerable groups. 
 
 
 
Research and development: 
 Addressing climate change requires strengthening scientific research and technological 
development in several areas, including technology transfer, economic aspects and related 
aspects of industry, oil, energy, transport development and other areas related to climate 
change and citizen life in order to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to it, so it 
is necessary to give importance to this aspect and provide the opportunity to prepare broad 
and deep studies on climate change and its multifaceted effects and support graduate students 
(master and doctoral) in adopting research and studies on climate change topics and increase 
the knowledge aspect of climate change.

Chapter Two 
 
 Climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation actions 
 
   The effects of climate change on various Iraqi sectors have become known to all and have 
cast a shadow on all life in Iraq, especially in light of the fragile conditions of the country and 
the dilapidated infrastructure, and the results of these effects have been clear on the sectors 
that directly affect the life of the citizen and his economic, water and food security, and their 
effects have been evident on the economic, health and life aspects in general, as projections 
based on national numerical climate models indicate a steady increase in temperature ranging 
between (0.9 m° ) since 2007 and may reach (3. 5 m) by the year 2100, according to the 
projections,5 m° ) by 2100 according to the aforementioned projections, which increases the 
critical situation in a country where the temperature has risen above (50 m° ) on a number of 
summer days of the year, not to mention the clear decrease in the annual rainfall rates, which 
is expected to witness a significant and continuous decrease that may reach in 2100 a 
decrease of more than 30% compared to its rates during the period 1938 - 1978, according to 
the forecasts of the General Authority for Climate Change. This is a clear indication of the 
reasons for the clear increase in the occurrence of extreme situations such as heat waves, 
drought and sudden heavy rainfall. For example, there are large waves of drought that led to 
an increase in the area of desertification, which affected the increase in dust and dust storms 
7 
 
during the year, whose intensity, frequency, frequency and time periods led to a noticeable 
increase in the number of asthma cases in Iraqi society, especially among children and the 
elderly, and the spread of diseases and cancers significantly. In addition, climate change has 
exacerbated the issue of water scarcity in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries, 
as the World Bank estimates for 2011 indicated that there is a significant shortage of 
renewable water resources for Iraq compared to the actual need during the period from 2000 
to 2009, while this percentage is expected to reach 37% during the period from 2020 to 2030, 
which will increase to 51% during the period from 2040 to 2050, which explains the reason 
for the major collapse in the agricultural sector, which has left its clear effects on agricultural 
production Iraq's economy, natural systems and biodiversity, the loss of vegetation cover, the 
threat to the marine coastal areas overlooking the Arabian Gulf, especially in Basra 
Governorate in southern Iraq, due to sea level rise and water warming, the impact on coral 
reefs and biodiversity in the marine environment and the loss of areas of coastal land, in 
addition to its effects on the energy sector, as Basra Governorate is the main centre of oil 
wealth in Iraq, which has created pressure on the national economy and a threat to the 
stability of the country, making it very difficult to achieve sustainable development in all its 
vital sectors, which hinders6). 
   Iraq is working on preparing a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) with funding from the 
Green Climate Fund (GCF) in cooperation with the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), which will be among the basic plans that the country will rely on in implementing 
this policy to ensure resilience for all vulnerable national priority sectors over the next three 
years to minimise potential risks and find effective ways to sustain water resources and 
address acute water scarcity and deteriorating water quality. As a result of the difficult 
economic conditions that Iraq is going through, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic and 
the unprecedented drop in oil prices, its implementation of this policy will need regional 
cooperation and international support to enable it to establish strong and resilient health 
systems to protect human health, protect natural systems and biodiversity, enhance resilience 
to impacts and disaster risks associated with local climate change scenarios, and promote 
adaptation in vulnerable sectors. 
   Given the synergistic relationship between the sectors, the preparation and implementation 
of an action plan for adaptation measures and the realisation of the required benefits for each 
of the main sectors affected by climate change and within the framework of the relevant 
national and sectoral strategies such as the National Water Strategy, the National Strategy for 
Agriculture, the National Biodiversity Strategy and the National Framework for Integrated 
Drought Risk Management in Iraq will lead to strengthening the national capacity to address 
the impacts of climate change on different sectors, especially those sectors that are most 
sensitive and vulnerable, as follows: 
 
 
1. Water Resources Sector: 
 
Top Pivots:    
1. Sustainable investment and preservation of groundwater for future generations, water harvesting, 
minimising water losses, using modern technologies to monitor and control groundwater 
reservoirs and determine their quality, and the need to maintain the pH balance of 
groundwater in general. 
8 
 
2. Desalination of seawater (and river water when required) and the use of renewable 
energy to power desalination plants and the development of new technologies. 
3. The construction of numerous dams and reservoirs to collect water, prevent flood risks, 
provide water quotas during dry periods, and recharge and sustain underground aquifers.  
4. Raising the efficiency of irrigation water use and working on finding modern high-
efficiency irrigation methods, minimising water consumption in accordance with the 
quality of crops, the nature of the soil and climatic conditions in order to adapt to the 
sharp decline in water resources, rehabilitating major irrigation projects, gradually 
linking spouts to the main drainage areas or evaporation basins to avoid their return to 
rivers, and using non-traditional water sources to provide the necessary water quotas for 
agricultural, industrial and service uses such as oil well injection and green belt irrigation, 
and reducing water wastage quantitatively and qualitatively. 
5. Activating national policies, laws and legislations that urge citizens to rationalise water 
use, with the need for specific measures against those who deliberately waste water. 
6. Urge the countries bordering the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries (Turkey 
and Iran) to respect Iraq's rights to its shared waters and strengthen regional cooperation 
with them to achieve water and climate security, which requires regional risk assessment, 
joint crisis management, damage-sharing and consideration of the country's water 
demands from shared rivers to meet its water needs for development sectors to achieve 
security and peace. 
Overarching goal: Increase the resilience of the country's water resources sector by 
adopting an integrated approach to address the increasing future need for water demand 
and reduce the potential deficit by developing water uses in line with the challenges of 
climate change and applying the themes mentioned in the Water and Land Resources 
Strategy until 2035 by providing financial and technical support and introducing 
alternative and non-conventional sources, taking into account the improvement of 
infrastructure and efficiency of supply and preserving water sources from pollution as 
part of the sustainability of these sources. 
 
2. Agriculture: 
Top Pivots: 
1. Reducing and rehabilitating soil, rangeland and vegetation degradation, improving land management 
practices and adopting smart and conservation agriculture, especially in the field of agriculture and  
2. Modernising, improving and developing agricultural practices and livestock development 
to achieve climate change adaptation.  
3. Establishing greenhouse and greenhouse farms and laboratories for tissue culture 
breeding of varieties resistant to climate change. 
Overarching goal: Increase the resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change to

Chapter Three  
Mitigation measures and co-benefits: 
   The main objective of mitigation policies is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taking 
measures and plans to prepare a document that strikes a balance between the requirements of 
the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement on the one hand and the diversification of the 
economy, the sustainability of fossil fuel exports and the stability of the global market for this 
type of fuel on the other hand to ensure the achievement of sustainable development goals 
until suitable alternatives are found and to limit the impact of response measures taken by 
developed countries on the economies of developing countries and the negative social and 
environmental implications and consequences that will cast a shadow on the economy. 
   The amount of reduction will be determined according to the nationally appropriate 
mitigation measures that Iraq will submit to the UNFCCC secretariat in the future in the form 
of plans, strategies, programmes and projects, which will be based on the baseline amount of 
the business-as-usual amount for each project that includes emission reductions and 
according to the main emitting sectors, targeting the main gases in the IPCC greenhouse gas 
lists, namely carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. 
  The most important sectors through which Iraq will work to achieve its NDC goals and 
diversify the sources of its national economy are oil, gas, electricity, industry, trade, 
agriculture, transport, waste and the housing sector. 
Pathways to mitigate emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases can be characterised as 
follows: 
- 
Widespread dissemination of the culture of environmentally friendly technologies 
that reduce emissions across all target gases, with a focus on mechanisms related to 
improving energy efficiency. 
- 
Mobilise efforts for mitigation measures to include all emitters. 
- 
Dissemination of knowledge and capacity building with support from developed to 
developing countries to ensure consistency among States Parties to ensure balance 
and equality of opportunity while taking into account the national circumstances 
and needs of each country. 
   Since its early accession to the Convention and its signing of the Paris Agreement, Iraq has 
been working on projects and strategic studies to introduce clean and renewable energies, 
improve energy efficiency, sound environmental carbon management and increase the area of 
green spaces. Projects have been initiated to introduce liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a 
fuel for vehicles in addition to the traditional fuels used and other pioneering projects in these 
fields and for many national sectors, including work on converting the lighting of many main 
streets in Baghdad to solar energy and developing future plans to convert some power plants 
to solar power, as well as the conversion of some power plants to solar energy. 
- 
Raising awareness of the importance of rationalising energy consumption. 
- 
Spreading the culture of using energy-efficient LED lighting to all government and 
commercial buildings. 
- 
Issuing energy efficiency labels by the Central Agency for Standardisation and 
Quality Control to ensure the use of environmentally friendly goods and services. 
14 
 
- 
Tyre recycling by the Ministry of Industry to reduce emissions. 
- 
Issuing green building codes, which is a policy in the creation of smart green 
buildings. 
- 
Issuance of the Solar Energy Law. 
- 
Utilisation of associated gas in the Basrah Gas Company. 
   ًً In addition to projects that have been implemented in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, such as 
the establishment of power plants that run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel instead of 
heavy fuel, the establishment of brick factories that use LPG instead of black oil, and iron 
production factories that run on kerosene instead of black oil, there are also many projects 
under completion, such as the project to exploit associated gas for power generation, cement 
factories that operate using waste-to-energy technology, a project to exploit associated gas for 
electricity production, and a project to treat wastewater and reuse it for irrigation of green 
belts, which is implemented in cooperation with the Japanese JICA organisation in Erbil 
governorate. This is not to mention the afforestation operations, increasing the areas of 
forests and planting green belts, noting that most of the new cities being built in the Kurdistan 
Region are sustainable cities that rely on smart lighting and the reuse of wastewater for 
irrigation to increase green areas and many others. 
International support and technology transfer is exceptionally important in preventing the 
waste of associated gas, which is an important economic wealth if exploited, as well as 
achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy 
Agency (IEA) estimates that methane leaks (the main component of natural gas) in Iraq could 
be reduced by more than 80 per cent using existing technology. The financial value of Iraq's 
methane emissions is estimated at more than $600 million, which represents a significant 
economic loss. In addition to the economic benefits to Iraq of monetising this gas, reducing 
methane emissions protects human health by improving local air quality. 
 
The pathways adopted by the national sectors are described below: 
 
1-  Energy sector (oil, gas, electricity and transport): 
   Through this vital sector, Iraq seeks to voluntarily reduce its emissions if security and peace 
are available on the one hand and developed countries fulfil their commitments in terms of 
financing, transfer of environmentally friendly technology and capacity building on the other 
hand, as the highest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions comes from this sector, as stated 
in the First National Communication, which contributes 75% of Iraq's total emissions. 
Therefore, taking the following measures to reduce emissions from this sector will be 
beneficial from a developmental point of view: The following measures will be taken to 
reduce emissions from this sector: 
- 
Reduce levels of associated gas flaring and utilisation in upstream oil and natural 
gas operations. 
- 
Invest in and develop the petroleum industry to reduce both resource depletion and 
emissions. In particular, improve and monitor associated gas flaring technology to 
minimise methane emissions and avoid ""venting"" through good design, including 
through gas recovery and recycling. 
- 
Conduct LDAR programmes in collaboration with international partners (Global 
Methane Alliance (GMA-) and oil and gas companies operating in Iraq) to 
periodically detect methane leaks in oil and gas facilities for the purpose of 
remediation.  
15 
 
- 
 Utilising combined cycles to increase electricity production  
- 
Changing the type of liquid fuel to gaseous fuel in power plants and improving the 
quality of the fuel used to reduce carbon emissions. 
- 
Reduce emissions by improving energy efficiency and rationalising energy 
consumption. 
- 
Converting heavy fuel-fired power plants to LPG and dry gas, which can be saved 
by capturing associated gas and minimising methane emissions. 
- 
Utilise hydroelectricity, which is a clean source of energy. 
- 
The use of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) or Carbon Capture, Storage and 
Utilisation (CCUS) technologies to reduce carbon emissions and utilise it in 
industrial processes. 
- 
Localisation of renewable energy technology, especially  with regard to solar 
energy, due to Iraq's strategic location, which is considered a promising area for 
the localisation of this type of technology. 
- 
The use of advanced and sustainable public transport and environmentally friendly 
technologies such as the construction of the funicular project and the gradual shift 
towards sustainable transport. 
- 
A gradual shift towards hybrid and eco-friendly vehicles. 
- 
Aircraft with more fuel-efficient engines and more efficient operating systems. 
- 
Review and modernise existing laws and identify the need for new laws in relation 
to trade laws, industrial investment and customs tariffs. 
- 
Wind power production in promising areas, especially in the Kurdistan Region. 
- 
Support the participation of the private sector in the development of the public 
transport system in accordance with participatory mechanisms with the public 
sector. 
 
 
 
 
2- Industry sector: 
ُ The industrial sector, with its public, private and mixed aspects, is one of the components of 
the non-oil economy in Iraq, and the contribution of this sector to the gross domestic product 
(GDP) reached an average of 2.4% during the years (2008-2011). The Ministry of Industry 
and Minerals, which manages this sector, which is one of the sectors thatُ contribute to the 
emission of greenhouse gases through a set of measures: 
1. Developing and qualifying industrial processes in existing projects by introducing 
low-carbon technologies, such as cement, bricks, fertilisers and petrochemicals.  
2. Recycling and waste management, such as projects that recycle heat and gases from 
industrial furnaces and recycle plastics and tyres.  
3. Supporting the private industrial sector in the field of emission reduction by applying 
the mechanisms mentioned in the industrial strategy, such as small and medium-sized 
enterprises, to support the development of technological pathways, innovation and the 
transfer of environmentally friendly industrial technologies.  
3- Agriculture Sector  
16 
 
   The agricultural sector is an important economic sector in the country and is one of the 
main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, as most of Iraq's crops are cereals such as 
wheat, barley, rice and maize, in addition to horticultural crops and palm trees. Therefore, the 
important measures in managing this sector to ensure a meaningful reduction in emissions 
can be summarised as follows: 
- 
Controlling the cultivation of crops that produce a large amount of methane gas, 
such as rice cultivation, as well as reducing its water consumption, combating soil 
erosion and rehabilitating degraded lands. 
- 
The use of alternative energy units such as solar and wind energy in the 
agricultural sector to operate irrigation pumps and the use of efficient irrigation 
systems. 
- 
Implement integrated management to combat natural forest fires and rehabilitate 
burned and degraded forests. Establish a system to protect and maintain natural and 
industrial forests, increase their areas and create green belts to minimise the 
emission of CO(2. 
- 
Increase environmental awareness on climate-smart agriculture. Improving 
nitrogen fertiliser application techniques to reduce N2O emissions and promoting 
no-till farming to reduce emissions from the use of agricultural machinery, as it has 
been successfully applied in the Kurdistan Region. 
- 
Reduce emissions from enteric fermentation in cattle and sheep by identifying and 
optimising suitable feeds. 
 
4- Waste sector: 
Iraq is seeking to localiseُ green investment in waste management to diversify its economy 
through the following measures: 
1- Passing the Solid Waste Management Law, which encourages waste recycling and 
waste-to-energy, and eliminates waste incineration. 
2- Using plasma technology to produce electricity from waste. 
3- Implementing an integrated waste management system. 
4- Utilising methane from landfill sites to produce electricity. 
5- Tire recycling project 
6- Energy production through waste treatment for electricity generation and heating, 
especially in modern cities adjacent to sewage treatment plants 
5- Housing sector: 
   Through the housing sector, Iraq seeks to apply the concepts of rationalising electricity 
consumption and moving towards low-emission pathways, depending  on the localisation of 
principles to stimulate the use of renewable energy in Iraq, as follows: 
1- Use energy-efficient lighting technologies. 
2- Using thermal insulation techniques. 
3- Issuing green building codes and modern technologies for thermal insulation, lighting 
and sustainable cities. 
4) Use efficient building design to maximise the use of lighting and solar energy. 
5- Implementation of photovoltaic technologies for distributed electricity in small towns 
and cities. 
17 
 
6- Integrated design that includes the use of smart meter technology within buildings. 
7- Integrated solar photovoltaic energy in buildings. 
8. Promote the production and use of environmentally friendly local building materials and 
products. 
9- Using modern construction techniques such as GRC and ICF, which are characterised by reducing the amount of 
rebar and cement used in construction 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chapter Four 
Monitoring, reporting and verification: 
  ًًُ The monitoring, reporting and verification system is one of the most important 
requirements necessary to build a transparent system that reflects our needs according to a 
solid methodology through which we can draw clear paths to characterise the legislation, 
18 
 
laws and regulations necessary to reduce emissions and the implications of this on adaptation. 
This system will also help in assessing the country's national needs for technology and 
capacity building to enhance emission reduction pathways in measured quantities that can be 
reported with the availability of digital measurements based on a legislative platform that 
includes all sectors. 
   Through the support mechanisms of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement and in 
cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Iraq seeks to obtain 
the necessary support to design the required monitoring format according to each sector, to 
include all forms of activities and all sectors in a flexible and scalable manner, as Iraq is 
aware that these systems willُ wellِ n the framework of transparency in the following: 
- 
National GHG inventory and reporting for each emitting activity. 
- 
Incentivise oil and gas companies operating in Iraq to report methane emissions 
within recognised transparent frameworks, such as the Oil, Gas and Methane 
Partnership (OGMP) framework.) 
- 
Collaborate on campaigns to directly measure methane emissions fromُ oil and gas 
facilities and use satellite data to establish a reference emissions baseline.  
- 
Evaluate the progress made in the implementation of the Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC). 
- 
Identify and assess the adverse effects of climate change on vulnerable sectors. 
- 
Characterising the co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation. 
- 
The impact of the implementation of response measures on the national economy. 
- 
Assessing national needs and the type of climate technology that contributes to the 
realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals 
- 
Identify the type of capacities that need to be built to ensure national mitigation 
actions are feasible in creating green jobs. 
- 
Determine the type of financing and investment that ensures the implementation of 
the national contribution in accordance with the country's national policy. 
- 
Localising technologies and software capable of creating predictive models for 
mitigation and adaptation  
- 
Characterising the verification profiles of actions taken to mitigate and adapt to 
climate change. 
- 
Identify the type, form and level of institutional structures required in accordance 
with international and national approaches to climate change. 
 
   Iraq is determined to advance the issue of climate change because it is aware of its 
seriousness at all levels as it seeks to establish the concepts of a green economy. However, 
the National Centre for Climate Change, which represents the institutional structure for 
managing climate change nationally, still needs more support to build and manage an 
integrated and transparent system for measurement, reporting and verification in particular, 
and to advance the status of the climate change file in general, as it needs international 
support financially, technically, technically and diplomatically ًًُIn order to build and manage 
an integrated and transparent system for measurement, reporting and verification in 
particular, and to improve the status of the climate change file in general, the National Centre 
for Climate Change needs international support financially  , technically  and diplomatically  to 
upgrade its climate capabilities and skills to enable it to participate in the formulation of 
international, regional and national policies to engage the international community in its 
actions to reduce the phenomenon of climate change.

Timeframe and implementation requirements: 
ُIraq aspires to implement its Nationally Determined Contributions for the time period from 
2021 to 2030 to achieve an expected reduction between 1%  - 2% of its total emissions 
according to the national greenhouse gas inventories by national effort and 15% when 
international financial and technical support is available and to achieve peace and security 
in accordance with the paths and directions outlined in this document in a way that ensures 
the achievement of mutual benefits to enable its vulnerable sectors to adapt to the harmful 
effects of climate change and after its people enjoy 24-hour electricity supply like the 
peoples of the world. The NAMA document will include details and implementation 
procedures, and will prioritise the electricity sector by investing in renewable energies 
worth up to 12 GW, based on the economic decisions of the Council of Ministers for 2021. 
 
Iraq can achieve reductions in its emissions and adaptation of its sectors after fulfilling the 
following requirements: 
▪ International financial support of up to $100 billion in accordance with the timeframe 
outlined in this document through grants and localisation of sustainable investment in 
the public and private sectors. 
▪ Supporting innovation and transfer of environmentally friendly technologies in line 
with national needs. 
▪ Stabilising the oil market in particular and ensuring that the national economy does 
not fluctuate in order to achieve the realisation of development plans in light of the 
sustainable development goals and in a way that contributes to diversifying the

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a

UPDATE OF ISRAEL'S NATIONALLY DETERMINED 
CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE PARIS AGREEMENT 
Submitted July 2021 
 
This submission is in response to paragraphs 24 and 25 of decision 1/CP.21 and in 
particular Israel's commitment to communicate or update its nationally determined 
contribution (NDC).  Israel has included in this document accompanying information 
to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of its NDC in compliance 
with Decision 4/CMA.1.  
Israel formally communicated its INDC under the Paris Agreement on 29 September 
2015 which became its NDC upon ratification of the Paris Agreement on 22 November 
2016. 
Since then, Israel has undertaken steps to increase its ambition. Most noteworthy is 
Government Decision 171 passed on the 25th of July 2021 entitled ""Transition to a Low 
Carbon Economy.” 
Unlike Israel's original NDC, this new Decision includes an unconditional absolute 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goal for 2030 of 27% relative to 2015 and 
an unconditional absolute GHG emissions reduction goal for 2050 of 85% relative to 
2015.  
Whereas our INDC submitted in 2015 projected 2030 emissions would be 81.65 
MtCO2e, under this update they are projected to be 58 MtCO2e by 2030. 
This updated goal significantly improves upon Israel's first NDC which was presented 
as a per capita economy-wide unconditional GHG reduction. The previous target was 
7.7 tCO2e by 2030 which corresponded to a total of 81.6 MtCO2e. The updated target 
presented in this NDC is 58 MtCO2e, which corresponds to a reduction of 23 MtCO2e 
or 29% in Israel' s total emissions.  
We believe that this updated NDC is a marked improvement both in the process by 
which the 2030 and 2050 national and sectoral goals were determined; in the more 
ambitious mitigation goal and in the work carried out to increase preparedness and 
adaptation to Climate Change. 
A multi stakeholder process, entitled ""Israel 2050: A Flourishing Economy in a 
Sustainable Environment"", took place over two years to determine 2050 low carbon 
goals from which 2030 goals and targets were derived, including recommendations 
for implementation. Some of these policies already exist and others will be the subject 
of future government decisions, ministerial policies or other tools as required. 
The main provisions of the recently adopted Decision 171 which set out updated 
national GHG reduction goals are as follows: 
✓ Revision of the existing national greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 
2030 set by Government Decision 542 so that the annual amount of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 will be reduced by at least 27% from the 
annual amount measured in 2015 (79 MtCO2e). The annual amount of 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 will be about 58 MtCO2e. 
✓ Approval of a national reduction target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, 
of at least 85% of the annual amount measured in 2015. Accordingly, the 
annual amount of greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 will be about 12 MtCO2e . 
✓ Recognition of the desirability of a net-zero emissions goal by 2050 and a 
global target to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore 
the 2050 target of 85% GHG emissions reduction will be periodically revisited. 
The following sectoral targets were set: 
✓ Transport 
o As of 2026, all new municipal buses purchased will be clean vehicles as 
defined in section 77A of the Transport Ordinance [New Version]. 
o Limit the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 
2030, so that the total increase in emissions will be only 3.3% compared 
to emissions measured in 2015, which were 17.6 MtCO2e. 
o Limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from new vehicles, 
weighing up to 3.5 tonnes, registered from 2030, to an amount equal 
to 5% of the average greenhouse gas emissions for a new vehicle, 
weighing up to 3.5 tonnes, registered in 2020. This target will be 
reexamined in 2025, and will be updated as necessary, having regard 
to technological developments, the extent of the penetration of 
electric vehicles in Israel and globally, electricity infrastructure and the 
deployment of charging stations in Israel . 
o Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 2050 by at 
least 96% compared to emissions measured in 2015 . 
✓ Waste 
o Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from solid waste by 2030 by at 
least 47% compared to emissions measured in 2015, which were 
5.5MtCO2e . 
o A 71% reduction in the amount of municipal waste landfilled by 2030 
compared to the amount of municipal waste landfilled in 2018, which 
was about 4.5 million tonnes . 
o Reduction of GHG emissions from municipal waste by 2050 by at least 
92% compared to emissions measured in 2015 . 
✓ Electricity Generation  
o Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation by 
2030 by 30% compared to emissions measured in 2015, which were 
37.6 MtCO2e, taking into account the renewable energy targets set in 
Government Decision No. 465 (see below). 
o Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation by 
2050 by at least 85% compared to emissions measured in 2015.  
✓ Energy Intensity 
o To set a new energy intensity target so that by 2030 the energy 
intensity of GDP will be 122 MWh per NIS 1 million . 
✓ Industry  
o Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from industry by 2030 by at 
least 30% relative to emissions in 2015, which were 12 MtCO2e.  
o Reduction of industrial greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 by at least 
56% relative to emissions in 2015. 
✓ Climate Impacts of Goods and Services  
o To establish a voluntary mechanism for reporting and publicizing 
information on the GHG emissions associated with products and services 
manufactured in and imported to Israel. 
 
Mid-century, long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies 
Government Decision 171 detailed above also includes targets for 2050 in furtherance 
of Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement, and paragraph 35 of decision 
1/CP.21 and constitutes Israel's current low greenhouse gas emission development 
strategy. GHG reductions will be reduced from 79.4 MtCO2e emissions in 2019 to 58 
MtCO2e in 2030 and 12 MtCO2e in 2050. 
 
Fair and ambitious 
Taking into consideration its national circumstances, Israel believes its target to be 
fair and ambitious reflecting genuine efforts to move forward in a sustainable 
manner to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. 
Further information can be found in section 6(a) of the ICTU table below. 
 
Key sectoral approved decisions and strategies contributing to the NDC’s 
achievement: 
Government Decision No 465 (approved on October 25, 2020) which formalized the 
decision undertaken by the Minister of Energy to phase-out coal-fired power 
generation no later than 2026 and determined targets for a renewable power 
generation share of 20% in 2025 and 30% in 2030. 
Implementation of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. In November 
2020, the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee of the Knesset amended the 
Hazardous Materials Regulations to set quotas on the import of HFC refrigerant gases, 
in line with Israel’s targets under the Kigali Amendment, to take effect in July 2022. 
National Waste Strategy: In February 2021, the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
published a new National Strategy for a Circular Economy in 2050 and a Sustainable 
Waste Sector in 2030. The strategy addresses treatment of Municipal Solid Waste 
(MSW) in a comprehensive manner and includes the following key abatement 
measures in relation to sources of GHG emissions. 
• Transition from 80% of waste landfilling in 2020, to only 20% by 2030;  
• Zero landfilling of untreated organic waste and paper and cardboard by 2030; 
• All active landfills will be sealed, and methane collection and 
destruction/utilization systems will be installed, so that methane collection 
will amount to no less than 50% of total methane production in the landfill. 
 
 
Implementation 
The government intends to review the national GHG reduction goals and strategy 
every five years which will also include an independent review process.  
More detailed information on implementation is included in Israel's Third National 
Communication and in Israel’s Second Biennial Update Report to be submitted in the 
near future.  
 
Monitoring Reporting and Verification  
In April 2016, the Israeli government set out in its National Greenhouse Gas 
Emissions Reduction Plan (Resolution 1403) the establishment of a national system 
for monitoring, reporting and verification, relating to the implementation of the 
program and national targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Further 
information can be found in the table below. 
 
Research and Development 
Israel continues to be one of the largest investors in Research and Development per 
capita among OECD countries. A portion of that investment goes to Clean Tech and to 
climate technologies specifically in areas in which Israel has a relative advantage such 
as water use, agritech, and adaptation to arid and semi-arid conditions.  
 
 
 
Adaptation to Climate Change  
Israel has also been focusing on formulating adaptation policies, based on the 
increasingly severe climate predictions and trends for Israel and the region. The 
government adopted a government decision in 2018 for Adaptation to Climate Change 
and established the National Adaptation to Climate Change Committee (NACCC). The 
role of the NACCC is to mainstream adaptation efforts in all government bodies and 
relevant organizations, to coordinate cross sector adaptation activities and projects, 
to mainstream adaptation and to develop and distribute climate knowledge.  
In 2019, The Israel Meteorological Service published the ""Climate change in Israel – 
historical trends and future predictions of temperature and precipitation Report"". This 
report presents the first comprehensive analysis of temperature and precipitation 
trends for Israel, based on data for various areas in Israel, and an analysis of projected 
climate models for the coming decades.  
The Adaptation Committee submitted its first National Adaptation Report in May 2021 
including recommendations to recognize Climate Change as a national security threat; 
outlining steps to be taken at the national and particularly at the local level for which 
a budget of 2.5 billion NIS over 5 years is proposed.  It is intended that this Report will 
form the basis of a future government decision.   
In the interim, the Water Authority, for example, is already incorporating data on the 
trends and projection into its master plans, thus maintaining Israel's ability to develop 
new desalination plants and to provide water supply both in Israel and for neighboring 
countries as well as continuing to develop innovation wastewater treatment and 
water recycling technologies. Enhancing the resilience of the public health system will 
be another area of focus  
Tel Aviv – Yafo was the first city to publish its Adaptation to Climate Change Plan in 
2020, in line with the C-40 covenant. 15 local authorities are currently developing their 
adaptation plans and In the next few years, it is expected that many more local 
authorities will follow suit. In recognition of the importance of the local government's 
role in adaptation efforts and in order to mainstream adaptation efforts, the NACCC 
developed Adaptation Guidelines for local government to be adopted by all local 
authorities.

Israel's target is economy-wide to achieve a 27% reduction in net GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 
2015, to a level of no more than 58 MtCO2e . 
 
In addition, Israel aims to achieve an 85% reduction in net GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2015, to 
a level of no more than 12 MtCO2e . 
 
In order to achieve its economy-wide target, Israel has also approved sectorial targets for 2030 and 2050 
(see above clause 1.d) 
 
General description of the target; 
(a)  
Sectors covered : 
• 
Energy (Fuel combustion) in: energy industries (electricity generation), manufacturing 
industries, construction, transport, other sectors (residential, commercial, institutional, 
agriculture) 
• 
Industrial Processes 
• 
Agriculture 
• 
Waste and Wastewater 
• 
Land-use Change and Forestry 
 
Greenhouse gases covered: 
Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6) . 
 
Categories covered : 
Category 1.B. “Fugitive emissions from fuels” is currently not covered by Israel’s NDC. However, this 
category is to be included in Israel’s National GHG Inventory in the future (see below, section 3(c). 
Initial estimates are that fugitive emissions constitute between 0.1% to 0.8% of Israel’s total GHG 
emissions  . 
 
LULUCF pools are negligible in Israel.  
 
The sectors, gases, categories and pools covered by Israel's NDC are based on the revised 1996 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories and the Global Warming Potential 
(GWP) values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (1995).

Planning process   
4.  
NDC update and Long-Term Low-Emission Development Strategy 
In early 2019, in cooperation with the Israel Democracy Institute and the OECD, the Israeli government 
initiated a broad and collaborative multi-sector process for formulating Israel’s Long-Term Low-GHG 
Emission Development Strategy to transition to a prosperous and low-carbon economy by 2050. Five 
sectoral working groups (power generation, transport, industry, waste, and cities and buildings) were 
established, as well as a macroeconomic team and a social impacts team, consisting of a broad range of 
relevant stakeholders. 
 
Information on the planning processes that 
the Party undertook to prepare its 
nationally determined contribution and, if 
available, on the Party’s implementation 
plans, including, as appropriate: 
 
(a)  
A public consultation process was launched once the sectorial teams were established in the beginning 
of 2019. This consultation process enabled a wide participation of the public in the on-going work of 
the sectorial teams. It resulted in the integration of insights and comments by the public within the 
Domestic institutional arrangements, 
public participation and engagement with 
local communities and indigenous peoples, 
in a gender-responsive manner; 
i. 
work of the sectorial teams, and ultimately it facilitated a more holistic and inclusive strategy for a low-
carbon transition. 
Inter-ministerial Steering Committee for GHG Emissions Reductions 
The decision-making process going forward is supported by an Inter-ministerial Steering Committee for 
GHG Emissions Reductions, which consists of representatives from all relevant government ministries 
and other relevant stakeholders. The Steering Committee submits an annual report to the government 
evaluating the effectiveness of government measures to reduce emissions, the progress towards 
meeting national GHG emission reduction targets and supporting targets and recommends additional 
measures as needed. 
 
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification of GHG emission reductions 
In April 2016, the Israeli government set out in its National Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan 
(Resolution 1403) the establishment of a national system for monitoring, reporting and verification, 
relating to the implementation of the program and national targets for reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions . 
To date, Israel monitors emission reduction on both a national and a policy level in accordance with 
the national Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system. 
The MRV system was implemented in 2016 by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in cooperation 
with other government ministries and relevant statutory bodies. It operates on the basis of guiding 
principles of the UN Climate Convention and on the basis of methodologies developed in accordance 
with the characteristics of the Israeli economy. It is managed by the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection, on behalf of the Steering Committee. 
Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate: 
ii. 
National circumstances are described in detail in Israel's National Communication submitted in 2018 and

detailed in its Voluntary National Review submitted to the UN  in July 2019. 
 
The establishment of sectorial working groups consisting of representatives of relevant ministries, local 
authorities, public representatives, NGOs, academia and others as described in section 4(a) above 
ensured broad public involvement and commitment, while the involvement of public policy think tanks 
and the OECD further contributed to the acceptability of the results. Within this context, establishing 
Israel’s Long-Term Low-Emission Development Strategy further informed the process to revise Israel’s 
2030 NDC targets. (See above clause 4.a.)

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as 
appropriate, removals: 
5 
In accordance with the modalities, procedures and guidelines outlined in Decisions 4/CMA.1 and 
18/CMA.1 of the Paris Rulebook, Israel will publish and submit to the UNFCCC, an annual National 
Inventory Report and Biennial Transparency Report by 31 December 2024 at the latest, and biennially 
thereafter.  
Assumptions and methodological 
approaches used for accounting for 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals corresponding to the Party’s 
nationally determined contribution, 
consistent with decision 1/CP.21, 
(a) 
The National Inventory Report will account for Israel anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals and 
the Biennial Transparency Report will report on progress towards the Israel’s NDC.  
Israel will compare achieved net GHG emission reductions with its NDC target for 2030.  
 
Israel will comply with future UNFCCC reporting guidelines on tracking, and reporting on progress.  
For current IPCC methodologies and metrics used, see section 5(d).  
Final accounting towards the target will take place in 2032. It will be based on the 2008-2030 Israel 
GHG Inventory, by comparing 2030 net GHG emissions to the 2015 reference year. 
 
paragraph 31, and accounting guidance 
adopted by the CMA; 
For domestic MRV and UNFCCC reporting see section 4(a)(i) above. 
Israel has established a market-wide and sector specific GHG emissions modelling framework which 
enables to forecast emissions throughout to 2050 given different scenarios, abatement measures and 
assumptions.    
In addition, Israel has an MRV system which produces the following annual information and results: 
 
→ Policy Measure Impacts: Within the MRV system framework, both achieved (ex-post) and expected 
(ex-ante) emission reductions are monitored for key policy measures . 
The expected reductions are calculated for each of the target years (2020, 2025 and 2030), for two 
levels of implementation : 
• 
Implementation of the policy measure to the extent that it has already approved (but not 
necessarily fully implemented) 
• 
Implementation in accordance with approved sectorial targets . 
 
Assumptions and methodological 
approaches used for accounting for the 
implementation of policies and measures 
or strategies in the nationally determined 
contribution; 
(b) 
→ Abatement Scenario Emissions: Abatement scenario emissions are forecasted for each of the   
target   years   and   each   of the abovementioned three levels of implementation. 
The MRV system facilitates the following: 
• 
Measurement of national progress towards achieving mitigation goals . 
• 
Measurement of the effectiveness of specific government GHG reduction policies and actions . 
• 
Revision and expansion of the policy actions to maximize the achieved economic and 
environmental benefits . 
• 
Fulfillment of reporting obligations to the UN on mitigation actions by Israel and their effects . 
• 
Transparency of information on Israel’s progress towards its reduction goals 
The monitoring is conducted on the basis of approved government methodologies, which define 
the calculation methodology, the parameters to be monitored, and the requisite QA/ QC 
procedures. The methodologies also define the manner in which overlapping effects between 
different government measures are accounted for in order to avoid double counting. 
The current methodologies under approval within the MRV system framework are : 
o Monitoring fuel consumption and emission reductions in power generation 
o Monitoring energy efficiency and electricity consumption 
o Monitoring energy efficiency in buildings 
o Monitoring grant programs and support for energy efficiency and reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions projects 
o Monitoring fuel consumption and emission reductions in the transport sector 
o Monitoring fuel consumption and emission reductions in industry and buildings sectors 
o Monitoring emissions reduction from the prevention of solid waste landfilling and 
emissions from the waste sector 
o Monitoring national targets for reduction of GHG emissions from fluorinated gases 
o Updating emission forecasts from agriculture, land use, wastewater and industrial 
process emissions 
 
See section 5(d) below 
 
 
If applicable, information on how the Party 
will take into account existing methods and 
guidance under the Convention to account 
for anthropogenic emissions and removals, 
in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 14, 
of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
(c) 
IPCC methodologies:  
The revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories were applied for the calculation of 
GHGs in all sectors, except agriculture and waste. Agriculture (category 4) is calculated according to the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories as of the 2011 Inventory year. Waste (category  6) 
was recalculated in 2012,  for all inventory years according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
 
Additional Guidance : 
In addition to the IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, the ‘Good Practice Guidance and 
Uncertainty Management in National GHG Inventories’ guidelines were used for preparation of the 
inventories. 
 
Tier Levels : 
The tier level applied in the national GHG inventory varies from sector to sector due to the varying 
availability of data and information : 
• 
Module 1-Energy: In principle, Tier 1 was applied, with notable exceptions being the application 
of Tier 2 using information that is unique to Israel such as calorific values of primary energy sources (coal, 
natural gas, shale oil). Tier 3 was applied for emissions of SOx, NOx, and CO from vehicles, as well as 
emissions of SOx and NOx from electricity generation . 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for 
estimating anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals; 
(d) 
• 
Module 2-Industrial Processes: In principle, Tier 1 was applied. For some sources emission 
factors specific to Israeli industry were used and therefore Tier 3 was applied. Regarding emissions of 
fluorinated gases, a methodology was adapted specifically to Israel and therefore Tier 3 was applied . 
• 
Module 3-Solvent and Other Product Use: There is no calculation of emissions from sources as 
such and therefore no tier level was applied yet . 
• 
Module 4- Agriculture: In principle, Tier 1 was applied, taking into account the specific processes 
in Israel’s agriculture sector and appropriate emission factors.For some sub sectors Tier 2 was applied. 
• 
Module 5- Land Use Change and Forestry: Israel uses the Tier 1 approach for estimating removals 
in forest land areas. There is no forest inventory in place as the forest land in Israel is negligible. However, 
data on forest land and on the mass of trees harvested do exist and are periodically updated . 
• 
Module 6- Waste: Tier 2 is applied to waste and Tier 1 to wastewater. 
 
Metrics: 
Global Warming Potential (GWP) values for a 100-year time horizon from the IPCC Second Assessment 
Report (1995). 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, including, as applicable: 
(e) 
Not applicable 
Approach to addressing emissions and 
subsequent removals from natural 
disturbances on managed lands; 
i. 
Not applicable 
Approach used to account for emissions 
and removals from harvested wood

Approach used to address the effects of 
age-class structure in forests; 
iii. 
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if applicable, estimating corresponding 
emissions and removals, including: 
(f) 
Final reference year and target year emissions will be based on the 2015-2030 GHG Inventory to be 
submitted to the UNFCCC in 2032 for the 2030 target year. Emissions estimates in Israel's GHG Inventory 
are made using methodologies outlined in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories and subsequent IPCC guidelines (see section 5(d)). The Inventory is revised annually and 
undergoes extensive review processes.

(g) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
6 
Taking into consideration its national circumstances, Israel believes its target to be fair and ambitious 
reflecting genuine efforts to move forward in a sustainable manner to facilitate the transition to a low-
carbon and climate-resilient economy. 
 
How the Party considers that its nationally 
determined contribution is fair and 
ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances; 
(a)  
Israel is a small and densely populated country characterized by an expanding population and 
economic growth, facing land and water scarcity. Arid zones comprise over 45% of the area of the 
country while there is an exceptionally high degree of biological diversity that must be protected . 
 
Electricity generation has been largely based on domestic and imported fossil fuels as Israel has no 
access to a number of widely used low-carbon sources of energy such as nuclear, hydro-electric and 
geothermal power. The country is an energy island, without grid interconnectivity. There is limited 
surface area available for large-scale energy installations. The few available areas are subject to 
competing uses such as industrial development and housing, bio-diversity preservation, habitat 
conservation, agriculture and defense. Electricity generation from renewable energy (mostly solar PV) 
amounted to 6.1% of the total electricity generation in 2020. 
 
For many years, there has been significant use of solar heaters for water heating and greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with water heating are substantially lower than the global average. An additional 
factor limiting Israel's abatement potential is its small share of heavy industry sector with relatively low 
emissions reduction potential. 
Israel attains extremely high levels of water reuse (85%). However, to meet increasing water demand 
several desalination plants have been constructed. These installations are comparatively energy 
efficient and currently account for 5% of energy consumption. Water scarcity may necessitate the 
construction of additional plants in the future. 
See above, section 6(a) 
 
Fairness considerations, including 
reflecting on equity; 
(b)  
Israel’s first NDC formulated a per capita GHG emissions target that did not entail a reduction in absolute 
emissions .  
How the Party has addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement; 
(c)  
Considering the previous target set in 2015 and revised population growth forecasts, the expected 
annual GHG emissions in 2030 would have been around more than 85 MtCO2e.  
The current target of 58 MtCO2e is significantly more ambitious.  
Israel's NDC is an economy-wide absolute emissions reduction target in compliance with Article 4.4 of 
the Paris Agreement. Sectorial targets were defined as well in order to facilitate successful 
implementation of the economy-wide target. See above, section 1(d). 
 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement; 
(d)  
Not applicable 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 6, of the Paris Agreement. 
(e)  
How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2: 
7 
This NDC represents Israel's contribution to achieving the objective of Article 2 of the Convention and 
reflects Israel's highest ambition at this time to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level 
that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  
 
How the nationally determined 
contribution contributes towards achieving 
the objective of the Convention as set out 
in its Article 2; 
(a)  
Israel has outlined its specific circumstances (a growing population, limited land use area, and limitations 
on the forms of suitable renewable energies, among others). Through its multisectoral consultation 
process, Israel has determined a mid-century long-term low carbon strategy which was formalized and 
approved by the government. Thus, Israel aims to support the collective effort to reach global peaking 
of GHG emissions as soon as possible (which is expected to occur in Israel by mid-decade), as set out in 
Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.  
 
How the nationally determined 
contribution contributes towards Article 2, 
paragraph 1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, 
of the Paris Agreement.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.

and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Jamaica 
 
Page | 2  
Summary 
• 
Jamaica remains committed to making its contribution as the world moves to address the 
challenge of climate change. In line with requirements of the Paris Agreement, the country 
has increased its ambition of the mitigation component of its Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC). This increase in ambition comprises both a broadening of the NDC’s 
sectoral scope and the delivery of greater emission reductions.  
• 
Jamaica has broadened its sectoral scope and taken steps to move towards an economy-wide 
target and will bring emissions from the land use change and forestry sector within its NDC 
for the first time. This reflects the importance of the forestry sector to Jamaica, which 
accounts for more than half of the island’s total land use, and the important commitments 
that the country has made to preserve and enhance these stocks. 
• 
The country has identified opportunities to deepen the emission reductions it delivers in the 
energy sector. These opportunities are part of an increasingly comprehensive approach to 
decarbonising this sector that covers both the electricity generation, as well as energy use 
sub-sectors. 
• 
The result of these positive changes is that Jamaica’s latest NDC will be significantly more 
ambitious. By 2030, it foresees emission reductions covering these two sectors of between 
25.4 per cent (unconditional) and 28.5 per cent (conditional) relative to a business-as-usual 
scenario (which takes into account policies in place as of 2005). This implies that emissions in 
these sectors would be 1.8 to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than they otherwise be, compared with a 
range of 1.1 to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC.  
• 
A crucial feature of Jamaica’s NDC is that it is based on the analytical work of the policies and 
grounded ambitious commitments that the country has already made. This ensures that the 
commitments are robust, benefiting from both political support and implementation plans 
already in place. This approach is crucial in both ensuring the legitimacy of Jamaica’s NDC to 
domestic constituents and in enhancing the credibility of the international process governing 
emission reductions. 
• 
As a small island developing state, Jamaica is acutely aware of how the physical risks of climate 
change threaten its development and the wellbeing and economic security of its citizens. 
Adaptation represents an important cross-cutting element for all sectors. Within the energy 
and land-use sectors, the policies in place to reduce emissions will also provide adaptation co-
benefits to Jamaica and therefore enhance the country’s resilience. For example, a shift to 
cleaner energy in the energy sector will reduce local air pollution and therefore benefit human 
health. This problem will otherwise be more severe as temperatures increase. Similarly, the 
preservation of the forest cover will improve water, soil and air quality, and reduce soil 
erosion. 
• 
All relevant GHG gases were accounted for using the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for the National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories and IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement. 
• 
Jamaica has opted to update its NDC in the information to facilitate clarity, transparency and 
understanding (ICTU) guidance template made available following discussions that framed the 
Katowice Rulebook at the twenty-fourth meeting of the Conference of Parties (COP 24). 
• 
Moving forward, Jamaica is committed to delivering on this NDC in keeping with its 
commitments as a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and 
the Paris Agreement. Jamaica welcomes the support of the international community as the 
country pursues these ambitious goals to consolidate its efforts to delink economic growth 
and development from emissions growth, while also making itself more climate-resilient.

UPDATE OF NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) OF JAMAICA (BASED ON THE ICTU GUIDANCE) 
1. Quantified information on the reference point, including, as appropriate, a base year 
a Reference year(s), base year(s), reference 
period(s) or other starting point(s) 
The target is not expressed relative to a base year. 
 
The reference year for the target is 2030 and the target is expressed 
relative to business-as-usual emissions in this year. Business-as-usual 
emissions have been calculated based on policies in place in 2005.   
b. Quantifiable information on the reference 
indicators, their values in the reference year(s), 
base year(s), reference period(s) or other 
starting point(s), and, as applicable, in the 
target year 
• Business-as-usual emissions in the energy sector in 2030: 
8.2MtCO2e 
• Business-as-usual emissions related to land use change and forestry 
sector in 2030: -1.0MtCO2e 
• Total business-as-usual emissions in 2030 of sectors in the NDC: 
7.2MtCO2e 
c. For strategies, plans and actions referred to 
in Article 4, paragraph 6, of the Paris 
Agreement, or polices and measures as 
components 
of 
nationally 
determined 
contributions where paragraph 1(b) above is 
not applicable, Parties to provide other 
relevant information 
Jamaica will undertake a range of actions concerning the sectors not 
covered by its quantitative commitments. These include the following: 
 
Agriculture: The Climate Change Policy Framework for Jamaica (2015) 
identifies the agriculture sector as a critical sector of importance for 
both mitigation and adaptation. Strategic aims include facilitating the 
use of water (and hence energy) efficient agricultural methods, 
improved food storage systems, and diversifying food production 
techniques including the expansion of agroforestry and aquaculture. 
 
Consistent with these strategic priorities, several important ongoing 
important projects in the sector are contributing to both GHG 
emissions reductions, carbon sequestration and enhanced climate 
resilience. For example, the Integrated Management of the Yallahs and 
Hope River Watershed Management Areas (Yallahs-Hope) Project, aims 
to improve the conservation and management of biodiversity and the 
provision of ecosystem services within the region; the watersheds 
accounts for around 7% of the island’s farmlands. This will be done by 
implementing sustainable agriculture (including renewable power 
generation), forestry, land management and livelihood practices within 
targeted communities. An initial estimate suggests that the avoided 
deforestation, reforestation and sustainable land management 
outcomes of the project could yield emission reductions of more than 
550,000tCO2e for the 4 years of the project. 
 
Other projects expected to contribute to low-emissions development 
in the agriculture sector include The Essex Valley Agriculture 
Development Project, and a project focused on Promoting Community-
Based Climate Resilience in the Fisheries Sector.  
 
Waste: Jamaica has introduced a single-use plastics ban. Since the start 
of 2019, the government has imposed a ban on the importation, 
manufacture, distribution and use of single-use plastic bags (of certain 
sizes) as well as plastic straws. From January 2019, there has been a 
ban on the importation of polystyrene foam (‘Styrofoam’) for use in the 
food and drink industry, while from the start of 2020, the ban was 
Update of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Jamaica 
 
Page | 4  
extended to cover the domestic manufacture of these items as well. 
The ban is complemented by a Plastic Waste Minimisation project. 
In addition, the country is currently developing proposals for a country-
wide Integrated Waste Management (IWM) PPP concession which is 
expected to improve the management and reduce the emissions of the 
waste sector.  
The country is also undertaking a range of pilot projects to explore 
biodiesel from cooking oil, the production of biogas using animal waste 
and increasing the use of biodigestors. 
d. Target relative to the reference indicator, 
expressed 
numerically, 
for 
example 
in 
percentage or amount of reduction 
• 25.4% reduction relative to business-as-usual emissions in 2030 
without international support (unconditional) 
• 28.5% reduction relative to business-as-usual emissions in 2030 
conditional upon international support 
e. Information on sources of data used in 
quantifying the reference point(s) 
The source data is that reported in Jamaica’s Third National 
Communication and 2018 Jamaica Integrated Resource Plan: A 20 Year 
Roadmap to Sustain and Enable Jamaica’s Electricity Future. Jamaica’s 
2013 Land Use Change Assessment (LUCA) and National Forest 
Inventory Report were used to estimate current forest cover and type. 
f. Information on the circumstances under 
which the Party may update the values of the 
reference indicators 
Jamaica may update the reference indicator to account for technical 
changes (e.g. changes in fuel prices, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
projections or any errors uncovered in the future) at the point of its 
next NDC submission.   
 
This approach has also been taken in this NDC with the business-as-
usual emissions in the energy sector being reduced relative to those 
projected in Jamaica’s first NDC. The first NDC had business-as-usual 
energy emissions in 2030 of 14.5MtCO2e whereas in the new baseline 
the comparable (energy sector) emissions are 8.2MtCO2e. 
2. Time frames and/or periods for implementation 
a. 
Time 
frame 
and/or 
period 
for 
implementation, including start and end date, 
consistent with any further relevant decision 
adopted by the CMA;  
Jamaica has already begun implementing the actions and activities 
needed to meet this commitment. It will continue to do so in the period 
through to 2030. 
b. Whether it is a single-year or multi-year 
target, as applicable.  
Single year target in 2030  
3. Scope and coverage 
a. General description of the target; 
Jamaica’s target to reduce emissions relative to business-as-usual by 
2030, covers the energy sector (supply and end-use) and land-use 
change and forestry. 
 
The inclusion of the land use change and forestry is a new addition to 
Jamaica’s NDC.  
b. Sectors, gases, categories and pools covered 
by the nationally determined contribution, 
including, as applicable, consistent with IPCC 
guidelines;  
Energy sector:  
• Carbon dioxide (CO2) 
• Methane (CH4) 
• Nitrous Oxide (N20) 
• Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) 
 
Land-use change and forestry: CO2 
c. How the Party has taken into consideration 
paragraphs 31(c) and (d) of decision 1/CP.21;  
Jamaica is committed over time to extending the scope of the coverage 
of its NDC to all categories of anthropogenic emissions in line with 
Update of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Jamaica 
 
Page | 5  
paragraph 31(c). In this update, emissions related to land use change 
and forestry were included along with the energy sector in this NDC.  
 
Jamaica conducted a detailed assessment to determine whether other 
sources and sinks of emissions could be included within its updated 
NDC but concluded that the data needed to rigorously assess the 
impact of policies and actions on emissions in other sectors was not 
available. Efforts will be made to address these data gaps over time 
with the support of national, regional and international partners.  
d. Mitigation co-benefits resulting from 
Parties’ adaptation actions and/or economic 
diversification plans, including description of 
specific projects, measures and initiatives of 
Parties’ adaptation actions and/or economic 
diversification plans.  
See 1 (c) 
4. Planning process 
a. Information on the planning processes that 
the Party undertook to prepare its NDC and, if 
available, on the Party’s implementation plans, 
including, as appropriate:  
The Climate Change Division of the Ministry of Economic Growth and 
Job Creation coordinated a highly participatory process with public and 
private sector stakeholders related to all key emission-intensive sectors 
in the economy. The purpose of these consultations was to curate the 
actual and planned strategies, policies and initiatives of relevance to 
the emissions profile of the country, as well as to understand the data 
sources that could support the development of the NDC. In total, 
representatives from more than ten (10) Ministries, Departments and 
Agencies of government along with International Development 
Partners, private sector entities and civil society were engaged at all 
levels for a period of over twelve 12 months at different stages of the 
development of the NDC. 
i. Domestic institutional arrangements, 
public participation and engagement with 
local communities and indigenous peoples, in 
a gender-responsive manner;  
ii. Contextual matters, including, inter 
alia, as appropriate:  
 
a. National circumstances, such as 
geography, climate, economy, sustainable 
development, and poverty eradication;  
Geography: Jamaica is a small island developing state in the Caribbean 
and highly dependent on natural resources. Its geographical location 
and biophysical landscape make it vulnerable to climate change 
impacts, especially for coastal sectors where persons depend on 
livelihood activities. 
 
Climate1: Jamaica has a tropical climate which is influenced by the 
Northeast Trade Winds and its geography, including mountains and 
hills. Average temperatures historically range from 24-27°C, varying 
according to elevation and proximity to the coast. The country has a 
bimodal rainfall pattern, typically peaking in May and October. The late 
rainfall season typically receives the largest volume of rainfall. Wind 
speeds tend to be highest during the drier months. 
 
The country is already experiencing the effects of climate change. There 
is an overall decline in annual rainfall, though there are spatial 
differences; rainfall is increasing over the centre of the island and 
decreasing rainfall over the eastern and western parishes leading to 
prolonged drier periods and more frequent and intense droughts in

these areas. The country is already managing the consequences of sea 
level rise.  
 
In the future, the trends observed in Jamaica’s climate will become 
more pronounced. Downscaled models show that temperatures 
continue to increase, including in the short to medium terms. 
Temperatures could increase by 0.82°C to 3.09°C by 2081 to 2100. The 
models also show a drying trend which is more pronounced in some 
sections of the island from the 2020s and being more extensive and 
intense by the 2030s when drying may be up to ~30%. Sea level rise will 
continue while hurricanes are expected to become less frequent but 
more intense.   
 
Economy: Jamaica is an upper-middle-income country that has 
nonetheless faced significant problems in the recent past due both to 
its vulnerability to natural disasters (many of which are climate-related) 
as well as other structural challenges. Its key economic areas include 
services industry (of which tourism is a part), as well as mining and 
quarrying sector. During 2020, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
the tourism sector has been significant which has also had a ripple 
effect on rural livelihoods which rely predominantly on the climate-
sensitive fisheries and agriculture sectors.  
 
In the recent past, Jamaica has been heavily focused on improving its 
macroeconomic fundamentals with a strong focus on reducing its 
public debt, controlling inflation, and reducing unemployment. These 
improvements have been characterized as an international success but 
are now threatened by the global fallout from the COVID 19 pandemic. 
 
Sustainable 
development: 
Vision 
2030 
Jamaica 
– 
National 
Development Plan, and its Medium-Term Socio-Economic Policy 
Framework (2018-2021) are underpinned by the three dimensions of 
sustainable development – social, economic and environmental – as 
well as equity and inclusiveness. It has made a strong national 
commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with 
assessments indicating a more than 90% alignment between Vision 
2030 Jamaica and the SDGs. Besides climate action (SDG 13), Jamaica is 
making particularly substantial progress on health and well-being (SDG 
3), quality education (SDG 4), and gender equality (SDG 5). 
 
Poverty eradication: Through the National Policy on Poverty and 
National Poverty Reduction Programme, Jamaica is actively seeking to 
end or significantly reduce poverty in all forms. This is complemented 
by a Social Protection Strategy and creating an enabling environment 
for businesses and economic activities to grow while increasingly 
putting in place measures to safeguard natural resources2. Data3 shows 
that poverty has fluctuated over the past decade and remains highest 
in rural areas. The government’s commitment to addressing poverty is 
reflected in its NDC through, for example, recognising the importance 
of increased agricultural production, the sustainable management of

Development (2018).

forest resources and the implementation of adaptation measures. 
Jamaica aims to move towards the eradication of poverty while 
simultaneously contributing to reducing global emissions. 
b. Best practices and experience 
related to the preparation of the NDC;  
A key feature of Jamaica’s approach to determining its NDC is that it is 
based on policies, initiatives, and commitments that the country has 
already made. This approach - by focusing on activities where there is 
political support and which, in many cases, benefit from existing 
implementation plans – serves to make its NDC robust. This approach 
helps ensure the legitimacy of Jamaica’s NDC to domestic constituents 
and enhances the credibility of the international process governing 
emission reductions. 
c. Other contextual aspirations 
and priorities acknowledged when joining the 
Paris Agreement;  
A commitment to reducing GHG emission levels nationally will require 
cleaner technologies, expertise and financing. 
 
Technology: The need for new innovations are embedded in the need 
to be more efficient and to produce from cleaner technologies. The 
availability and transfer of technologies that are environmentally sound 
and which support low carbon and climate-resilient development is 
paramount. As a small island developing state these opportunities are 
not often readily accessible and so the spirit of the Paris Agreement 
would help to foster North-South Cooperation. 
 
Expertise: The integration and transformation of new ideas and 
technologies into the economy, society and environment will take 
some capacity development for their appropriate applicability and 
proliferation.  
 
Financing: Technology transfer and capacity development cannot take 
place without sufficient financial resources made available to 
undertake the transition. As an indebted and highly vulnerable state to 
the impact of climate change, it is important to find the right balance in 
building the country’s resilience and in implementing the necessary 
adaptation and mitigation measures, while supporting the day to day 
needs of the country. The measures necessary to effect the transition 
are cost-intensive. 
b. Specific information applicable to Parties, 
including 
regional 
economic 
integration 
organizations and their member States, that 
have reached an agreement to act jointly under 
Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, 
including the Parties that agreed to act jointly 
and the terms of the agreement, in accordance 
with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of the Paris 
Agreement;  
Jamaica is not part of an agreement to act jointly under Article 4 of the 
Paris Agreement. 
c. How the Party’s preparation of its NDC has 
been informed by the outcomes of the global 
stocktake, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement;  
The first global stocktake will take place in 2023.  
 
Jamaica participated in the Talanoa Dialogue in 2018, which generated 
political momentum for enhanced climate action, including calling for 
Parties to update their NDCs.  
 
Reflecting this momentum, Jamaica’s new NDC is more ambitious than 
its previous one, both in terms of its sectoral coverage (the inclusion of 
land use change and forestry emissions) and in terms of a commitment 
Update of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Jamaica 
 
Page | 8  
to deeper emission reductions in the energy sector. By 2030, emissions 
covered by the NDC will be 1.8 to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than under a BAU 
scenario. These reductions relative to business-as-usual (BAU) in 2030 
compare with a range of 1.1 to 1.5 MtCO2e in Jamaica’s previous NDC.  
d. Each Party with an NDC under Article 4 of the 
Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation 
action and/or economic diversification plans 
resulting in mitigation co-benefits consistent 
with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on:  
N/A 
i. How the economic and social 
consequences of response measures have 
been considered in developing the NDC;  
N/A 
ii. Specific projects, measures and 
activities to be implemented to contribute to 
mitigation co-benefits, including information 
on adaptation plans that also yield mitigation 
co-benefits, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, key sectors, such as energy, 
resources, water resources, coastal resources, 
human settlements and urban planning, 
agriculture and forestry; and economic 
diversification actions, which may cover, but 
are 
not 
limited 
to, 
sectors 
such 
as 
manufacturing and industry, energy and 
mining, 
transport 
and 
communication, 
construction, tourism, real estate, agriculture 
and fisheries.  
N/A 
5. Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals: 
a. 
Assumptions 
and 
methodological 
approaches 
used 
for 
accounting 
for 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals 
corresponding 
to 
the 
Party’s 
nationally determined contribution, consistent 
with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, and 
accounting guidance adopted by the CMA;  
Jamaica will account for its anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals 
using the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, IPCC Good 
Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands 
(IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement) was also utilized. 
b. 
Assumptions 
and 
methodological 
approaches used for accounting for the 
implementation of policies and measures or 
strategies in the nationally determined 
contribution;  
See 5(a) above. Jamaica will also apply specific assumptions and 
methodologies, where relevant, when accounting for the progress of 
various policies and measures in its Biennial Update Report or Biennial 
Transparency Report. 
c. If applicable, information on how the Party 
will take into account existing methods and 
guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 14, of the 
Paris Agreement, as appropriate;  
See 5(a) above. 
d. IPCC methodologies and metrics used for 
estimating anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals;  
Jamaica’s emissions for CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3 will be 
derived using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the IPCC 2013 Wetland

The aggregation of GHG emissions have been estimated, and will be 
reported, using the 100-year time-horizon global warming potential 
values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. 
e. Sector-, category- or activity-specific 
assumptions, methodologies and approaches 
consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable:  
 
i. Approach to addressing emissions and 
subsequent 
removals 
from 
natural 
disturbances on managed lands;  
GHG emissions and removals from natural disturbances, if any, will be 
accounted for in accordance with the prescribed 2006 IPCC Guidelines, 
coupled with field inventory measurements where applicable. 
 
No allowance was made for natural disturbances within the NDC. 
ii. Approach used to account for 
emissions and removals from harvested wood 
products;  
Due to the limited scale of harvested wood products in Jamaica these 
were not included when developing the NDC. 
iii. Approach used to address the effects 
of age-class structure in forests;  
Jamaica estimates GHG emissions and removals in the LUCF sector, 
using the maximum tier for which data is available. It will apply country-
specific data resulting from field inventory measurements undertaken 
at regular intervals and estimated by modelling approaches. The field 
measurements will take into consideration tree growth information 
across the range of tree species and diameter classes for all forest 
types. 
 
The NDC used historical planting and removal data to estimate the age 
distribution of existing forest cover and applied the appropriate 
emissions factors from the IPCC. 
f. Other assumptions and methodological 
approaches used for understanding the 
nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, 
estimating 
corresponding 
emissions and removals, including:  
 
i. 
How 
the 
reference 
indicators, 
baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), including, 
where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-
specific reference levels, are constructed, 
including, for example, key parameters, 
assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data 
sources and models used;  
The baseline for assessing emission reduction from land use change 
and forestry was determined using Jamaica’s 2013 Land Use Change 
Assessment. Projections for land-use change for the period to 2030 in 
the baseline take account of the historical trends reported in this 
document as well as Jamaica’s agricultural production targets as set out 
in Vision 2030 Jamaica. The analysis then calculates how land-use 
patterns will change as a result of key policies (no net loss of forest 
cover, tree planting). Changes in land use are then aligned with 
emissions factors from the IPCC’s Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories to estimate the implications these changes have for 
both emissions and removals. 
 
The baseline emissions in the energy sector were calculated using the 
Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) model. This 
combines demographic and economic growth projections from the 
Statistical Institute of Jamaica, the UN World Population Prospects and 
the World Bank, to develop a business-as-usual forecast for energy 
sectors emissions given the policies that were in place in Jamaica as of 
2005. GDP is assumed to grow at around 2% per annum between 2019 
and 2030, based on IMF projections. Gradual population growth is also 
expected, from 2.7m in 2018 to 2.8m in 2030, based on historical data 
from the Statistical Institute of Jamaica and projections from the UN.

g. The intention to use voluntary cooperation 
under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, if 
applicable.  
Jamaica is committed to contributing to discussions on international 
cooperation through Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Depending on 
the outcome of these negotiations, the country will explore how it can 
use these mechanisms either to support the achievement of its own 
NDC or to provide additional mitigation outcomes to support NDC 
attainment by other countries. 
6. How the Party considers that its NDC is fair and ambitious in light of its national circumstances  
a. How the Party considers that its NDC is fair 
and ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances; 
Jamaica’s updated NDC reflects its strong commitment to the 
implementation of the Paris Agreement. It will be subject to all relevant 
laws, guidelines, policies and programmes which are designed to 
increase inclusiveness and fairness, including the Code of Consultations 
and the National Policy for Gender Equity. 
 
As set out below, the updated NDC is considerably more ambitious than 
its first. Despite being a developing country and a SIDS, under this NDC, 
and given current expectations, within the covered sectors, Jamaica will 
move closer to decoupling economic growth from its emissions profile. 
Over the ten years between 2020 and 2030, emissions are projected to 
only grow very slightly within the sectors covered by its NDC, despite 
expected continued growth of the economy. 
 
The country’s emissions per capita will remain substantially lower than 
the global average.  
b. Fairness considerations, including reflecting 
on equity;  
c. How the Party has addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement;  
Jamaica’s revised NDC represents a significant enhancement on its first 
NDC. 
 
Jamaica is taking steps to move towards an economy-wide target and 
has brought emissions from the land use change and forestry sector 
within its NDC for the first time. This reflects the importance of the 
forestry sector to Jamaica, which accounts for more than half of the 
island’s total land use, and the important commitments that the 
country has made to preserve and enhance these stocks. 
The country has also identified opportunities to deepen the emission 
reductions it delivers in the energy sector. These opportunities are part 
of an increasingly comprehensive approach to decarbonising this sector 
that covers both the electricity generation, as well as energy use sub-
sectors. 
 
The result of these positive changes is that Jamaica’s latest NDC will 
approximately double in ambition. By 2030, the emission reductions in

these two sectors of between 25.4 per cent (unconditional) and 28.5 
per cent (conditional) implies that emissions in these sectors would be 
1.8 to 2.0 MtCO2e lower than in the BAU scenario. This compares with 
a range of 1.1 to 1.5 MtCO2e in its previous NDC. This implies that the 
absolute level of ambition in Jamaica’s unconditional commitment has 
increased by more than 60% when comparing the First NDC and the 
updated NDC. 
 
Jamaica has also prepared its NDC following ICTU guidance to provide 
information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding. 
7. How the NDC contributes towards achieving the objectives of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 
a. How the NDC contributes towards achieving 
the objective of the Convention as set out in its 
Article 2;  
In 2015, Jamaica’s per capita GHG emissions were just 3.6 tCO2e per 
person, fully 45% below the global average of 6.6 tCO2e. Despite this 
low starting point, the country is now proposing an NDC that, under 
current projections, is consistent with virtually decoupling its economic 
growth from its covered emissions. As such, despite being a developing 
country, Jamaica is playing its part in global emissions peaking as soon 
as possible, as set out under Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.  
b. How the NDC contributes towards Article 2, 
paragraph 1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, of 
the Paris Agreement.

Japan’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) 
 
Japan’s Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Target 
 
 Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent in fiscal year (FY) 
2035 and by 73 percent in FY 2040, respectively, from its FY 2013 levels, as ambitious 
targets aligned with the global 1.5°C goal and on a straight pathway towards the 
achievement of net zero by 20501. 
The details of the action policy as well as targets and estimates by greenhouse gases 
and other classifications are described in the Plan for Global Warming 
Countermeasures, which is a comprehensive implementation plan for achieving Japan's 
NDCs2, and in its related materials. 
 
1   In October 2020, Japan declared that it would aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emission 
by 2050. In April 2021, Japan declared that it would aim to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 
by 46 percent in FY 2030 from its FY 2013 levels, as an ambitious target which is aligned with 
the 2050 goal, and furthermore, continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty 
goal of cutting its emissions by 50 percent. Based on the above, in October 2021, Japan 
submitted its NDC that included the reduction target for FY2030.

4. Planning processes: 
(a) 
Information on the planning processes that the Party undertook to prepare
its nationally determined contribution and, if available, on the Party’s 
implementation plans, including, as appropriate: 
At the joint meetings of the Climate Change Countermeasures towards Net Zero by 2050 
Subcommittee of the Global Environment Committee under the Central Environment Council and 
the Working Group for Consideration of Mid- and Long-Term Global Warming Countermeasures 
of the Global Environment Subcommittee of the Committee on Innovation and Environment under 
the Industrial Structural Council, with participation of various stakeholders including industry, 
academics, local governments, labor unions, NGOs, and others, substantive consideration was 
undertaken on the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures, a comprehensive plan towards 
achieving the NDC, in a manner transparent to the public, while holding hearings from future 
generations and relevant ministries and agencies. 
With regard to energy policy and energy mix, substantive consideration was undertaken in a 
manner transparent to the public at the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for 
Natural Resources and Energy. 
After the above procedures, the Government prepared a draft of the Plan for Global Warming 
Countermeasures, including the NDC, which was adopted by the Global Warming Prevention 
5 
 
Headquarters. 
Following this, the government invited public comments widely regarding the government draft 
from citizens and the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures, including the NDC, was adopted 
by the Global Warming Prevention Headquarters.  
(a) (i) 
Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement
with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender-responsive
manner; 
Towards the achievement of a sustainable society, Japan is proactively working to incorporate 
gender perspectives, including gender equal participation, into concrete actions while aiming at 
enhanced participation of women in policy decision-making processes for responding to 
environmental problems, including climate change, in line with ongoing international trends. For 
example, Japan is promoting the participation of women in councils and other bodies. One initiative 
ensures that half of the members of the meeting ― a joint meeting of the Climate Change 
Countermeasures towards Net Zero by 2050 Subcommittee of the Global Environment Committee 
under the Central Environment Council and the Working Group for Consideration of Mid- and 
Long-term Global Warming Countermeasures of the Global Environment Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Innovation and Environment under the Industrial Structural Council―are women. 
In addition, Regional Energy and Global Warming Prevention Promotion Councils established 
in each regional block are used in cooperation with local governments and regional councils for 
global warming countermeasures to back up regional efforts for global warming prevention in 
collaboration with relevant ministries and agencies.

(a) (ii) b 
Best practices and experience related to the preparation of the Nationally
Determined Contribution; 
As already mentioned in a (i), specific consideration regarding the Plan for Global Warming 
Countermeasures, including the NDC, was undertaken in a manner open to the public, at the joint 
meetings of the Climate Change Countermeasures towards Net Zero by 2050 Subcommittee of the 
Global Environment Committee under the Central Environment Council and the Working Group 
for Consideration of Mid- and Long-Term Global Warming Countermeasure of the Global 
Environment Subcommittee of the Committee on Innovation and Environment under the Industrial 
Structural Council, as well as at the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for 
Natural Resources and Energy. 
On July 17th, 2015, Japan submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) 
to the UNFCCC Secretariat. Following that, on May 13th, 2016, Japan made a Cabinet Decision on 
the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures. Every year since the formulation of the plan, the 
Global Warming Prevention Headquarters, led by the Prime Minister with all Cabinet Ministers as 
its members, have made rigorous reviews and examinations on, among others, the state of progress 
in each countermeasure taken by the Government, by using the outcome in emission reductions by 
greenhouse gases and other classifications, measure evaluation indicators, and related indicators. 
Specifically, by administering evaluations on each section of measures and policies and 
identifying sections whose progress is delayed, the Government conducted examinations on, among 
others, how to improve progress in the identified sections. In so doing, the Government considered 
not only the enhancement of measures and policies that are already included in the Plan for Global 
Warming Countermeasures but also the introduction of new measures and policies. 
Also, with regard to the new target, the Government will continue progress management in a 
similar manner to the one mentioned above while also flexibly reviewing and strengthening policies 
and measures. 
Japan will promote initiatives to contribute to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, 
including those that do not count towards achieving Japan's NDC. Building upon the relationship 
of trust that has been established to date and platforms such as the Asia Zero Emission Community 
(AZEC), Japan will expand cooperation based on collaboration with partner countries, such as the 
7 
 
Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) and City-to-City Collaboration Program, and promote further 
environmental improvements, such as market creation of decarbonizing products/services, human 
resource development, and institutional establishment, by taking advantage of Japan's strengths in 
technology. By doing so, Japan will promote business-led international deployment of technologies 
and products with high environmental performance, and make the greatest possible contribution to 
emissions reductions and removals regionally and globally.

Other contextual aspirations and priorities acknowledged when joining the
Paris Agreement; 
Not applicable. 
(b) 
Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris

Paris Agreement; 
Not applicable. 
8 
 
 
 
(c) 
How the Party’s preparation of its nationally determined contribution has
been informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake, in accordance with 
Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement; 
Japan formulated its new NDC taking into account the outcomes of the first global stocktake at 
CMA5 (decision 1/CMA.5). At the outcomes of the first global stocktake, the need for urgent 
action to achieve the 1.5°C goal was emphasized, and the need for global emissions to peak before 
2025 was recognized. As concrete actions to achieve this, it was decided to encourage Parties to 
formulate economy-wide emission reduction targets, covering all greenhouse gases, sectors and 
categories (paragraph 39), and tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global 
average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030, as well as accelerating efforts 
towards the phase-down of unabated coal power, transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy 
systems, accelerating zero- and low-emission technologies (paragraph 28), transitioning to 
sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production (paragraph 36), and 
others. 
Japan's new NDC sets ambitious targets aligned with a straight pathway towards the global 
1.5°C goal and the achievement of net zero by 2050 based on scientific findings from the IPCC and 
other sources. This target is an economy-wide emission reduction target, covering all greenhouse 
gases, sectors and categories. 
The items listed in decision 1/CMA.5 have been incorporated to the greatest extent possible into 
the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures, which is a comprehensive implementation plan for 
achieving Japan's NDC.

Not applicable. 
(f) (iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement, if applicable. 
Japan will establish and implement the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) in order to 
quantitatively evaluate the contributions of Japan to greenhouse gas emission reductions and 
removals which are achieved through the diffusion of, among others, decarbonizing technologies, 
products, systems, services, and infrastructures as well as through the implementation of 
measures in global south countries and others, and to use such contributions to achieve Japan’s 
NDC. With these efforts, through public-private collaborations, Japan aims to secure 
accumulated emission reductions and removals at the level of approximately 100 million t-CO2 
13 
 
by FY 2030 and approximately 200 million t-CO2 by FY 2040. Japan will appropriately count 
the acquired credits to achieve its NDC. 
With regards to the JCM which Japan has initiated to establish, Japan secures environmental 
integrity and the avoidance of double counting in line with the international rules, including the 
Paris Agreement. Based on its experience gained through the development and implementation 
of the JCM, Japan participates in international discussions with regard to Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement, thereby taking the lead in the development of appropriate international rules for the 
use of market mechanisms and its improvement through the implementation. 
Furthermore, Japan will also make proactive efforts in the area of international cooperation 
to promote net zero and to improve resilience in global south countries and others, including from 
developing policies and institutional platforms to promoting sector- and city-level efforts as well 
as facilitating technology diffusion. 
6. How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:

(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair
and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances; 
As ambitious targets aligned with the global 1.5°C goal and on a straight pathway towards the 
achievement of net zero by 2050, Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent 
in FY 2035 and by 73 percent in FY 2040, respectively, from its FY 2013 levels. 
At present, while net greenhouse gas emissions in Japan are on a steady downward trend 
towards the achievement of net zero by 2050, the factors include not only the reduction of energy 
consumption and decarbonization of electricity, but also the reduction of production volume in 
the industry sector. Steadily and unflaggingly pursuing the path towards net zero by 2050 while 
realizing emission reduction and economic growth simultaneously is not an easy task, and it is 
essential to position net zero as one of the main issues in all socioeconomic activities and to promote 
the transition to a sustainable and resilient socioeconomic system. In order to achieve this goal, 
Japan will promote policies that contribute to growth with net zero as the axis, in collaboration with 
the GX (Green Transformation) policy, which aims to simultaneously achieve stable energy 
supplies, economic growth, and decarbonization. 
As a country that supports manufacturing around the world, Japan would like to take a 
leadership role in the global efforts towards net zero by showing the world that Japan is steadily 
making progress with an ambitious yet realistic approach. 
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
Japan’s target is highly transparent and concrete, with breakdowns by gases and sectors clearly 
stated. Each Party’s submission and sharing of information by gases and sectors in this manner 
would contribute to improving transparency, ensuring fairness, and also enabling effective reviews. 
This would promote gas- and sector-specific actions, which would lead to fair and efficient 
reductions of global emissions. 
(c) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris
Agreement; 
Refer to 6a. 
(d) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris
Agreement; 
Japan’s NDC is an economy-wide absolute emission reduction target. 
(e) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 6, of the Paris
Agreement. 
Not applicable. 
15 
 
7. How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2: 
(a) 
How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards
achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2; 
Refer to 7b. 
Japan’s new NDC and its efforts towards the achievement of net zero by 2050 contribute to the 
objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas 
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic 
interference with the climate system. 
(b) 
How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards Article 2,
paragraph 1(a) and Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement. 
Japan’s new NDC is consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement as set out in 
its Article 2, paragraph 1 (a), to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 
2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C 
above pre-industrial levels. 
Furthermore, this NDC is ambitious as aligned with  the global 1.5°C goal and on a straight 
pathway towards the achievement of net zero by 2050, and contributes to Article 4, paragraph 1 of 
the Paris Agreement, which stipulates that Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas 
emissions as soon as possible, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best 
available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and 
removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.

     The State of Kuwait has updated the document of the Nationally 
Determined Contributions and submitted it to the secretariat of the 
Convention to share worldwide: the process of combating climate change 
based on sustainable development plans and programs at the national level 
for the period from 2015 to 2035. 
     Based on the principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, the provisions of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable 
Development Goals (Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development), the State 
of Kuwait seeks to transition to a low-emissions carbon-equivalent economic 
system based on its future business in the principles of a circular economy of 
carbon in addition to legislation and laws in the areas of mitigation and 
adaptation Climate change based on the expectations of its future emissions 
according to business as usual patterns for the period between 2015-2035. In 
this period, the State of Kuwait has been seeking to avoid emitting the 
equivalent of 7.4% of its total emissions in 2035 with unconditional national 
efforts. Moreover, this percentage of emissions reduction represents the 
country’s maximum ambition which the country of Kuwait had based on 
national conditions and economic, political, social and health developments 
during the Corona pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021 and the resulting 
stagnation of the global economy, and the state’s efforts to pandemic the virus 
on the other.

Introduction: 
The State of Kuwait is considered one of the first countries to sign the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; it joined the Convention 
on 28 Dec.1994 and entered into force on 28 Mar. 1995, and the state of 
Kuwait ratified Kyoto Protocol under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change on 11 Mar. 2005 and entered into force on 9 
Jun. 2005. The State of Kuwait shares the concerns of the international 
community in limiting the negative impacts of climate change, it recognizes 
that the global nature of climate change calls for maximum cooperation and 
participation in an effective international response in implementing the terms 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCCC) 
from all countries of the world in accordance with common but differentiated 
responsibilities as stated in Article 4 paragraph 1 , which says: “All Parties, 
taking into account their  common but  differentiated responsibilities and their 
specific national  and regional development priorities, objectives and  
circumstances."" 
 
The State of Kuwait also signed the Paris Climate Agreement on 4/22/2016 
and submitted its first contribution document at the national level after 
ratification on 4/23/2018 based on the information, results and analyses 
contained in the first national communication document submitted by the state 
in 2012. Moreover, based on the latest documents submitted by the State of 
Kuwait to the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change recently, where the second national communication (SNC) 
was submitted in July 2019, and the document of the first Biennial  update 
report (BUR) was submitted in September 2019, in addition to the National 
Adaptation Plan (NAP) in February 2021 Therefore, the State of Kuwait has 
updated the first national contributions document based on the latest 
information contained in these documents related to the inventory of 
emissions and ways to adapt to the negative effects of climate change on the 
state's sectors. 
In this context the standards of sustainable development of the State of Kuwait 
will be taken into consideration, as it is a developing country with a single source 
of income as the Convention stated in Article 4 .8, which says: "" In the 
implementation of the commitments in this Article,  the Parties shall give full 
consideration to what actions are  necessary under the Convention, including 
 
5 
 
actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the  
specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties  arising from the 
adverse effects of climate change and/or the  impact of the implementation of 
response measures” and in particular on “Countries whose economies are highly 
dependent on  income generated from the production, processing and  export, 
and/or on consumption of fossil fuels and  associated energy-intensive products” 
as mentioned in paragraph (h). 
 
First: national circumstances of the state of Kuwait:  
Kuwait is located in the Northeast of the Middle East and North Africa 
between latitudes 28o 30"" and 30o 5"" and longitudes 46o 33"" and 48o 30"" in 
the east. The total area of Kuwait is 17,818 km2, including the nine 
unpopulated islands in the Arabian Gulf region. Kuwait's Government is 
considered constitutional state, where its Constitution has a democratic appeal 
which is developing rules that controls legislative, executive, and judicial 
authorities. 
(1) Effects of climate change on the State of Kuwait: 
The State of Kuwait is a tropical dry and subtropical desert with an extremely 
arid climate. Its annual precipitation ranges between 75 and 150 mm, but the 
actual precipitation is 600 mm per year. There are large and noticeable 
differences in temperature between summer and winter in Kuwait. In summer, 
the temperature can reach 48 degrees Celsius and an average of 44 degrees 
Celsius, and on July 21, 2016, the temperature reached its highest level ever, 
as the temperature reached 54 degrees Celsius in the north of the State of 
Kuwait, and it is worth noting that it was the highest temperature recorded 
throughout history in the Eastern Hemisphere and Asia, according to the 
World Meteorological Organization report issued in June 2019.  
Due to its relatively northern location in the Gulf region, the northern winds 
blowing from Iran and Iraq ensure that the temperature of Kuwait is lower 
than that of other Arab Gulf states. Precipitation occurs mostly from October 
to April. 
During the summer, which is much longer than the winter, violent northwest 
dust storms dominate most weather events during the months of March 
through April, and in the later months of hot summer, between May and 
September, sandstorms are more likely, and southeast winds blow during the 
period From September to October from the Arabian Gulf, hence the humidity 
during these months (Second National Communication, 2019). By the end of 
October, the cycle of winter and summer begins again, as the temperature 
 
6 
 
drops to -6°C during the night. The daytime is usually characterized by higher 
temperatures ranging from 10 to 17 degrees Celsius. 
According to its climate, the State of Kuwait suffers the lack of fresh water, 
with an annual precipitation ranges between 75 and 150 mm, which is low 
respectively.  (Figure. 1) 
Kuwait relies entirely on sea water desalination process to obtain fresh water 
where is 93% from the water supply comes from the desalination of sea water, 
while the remaining percentage comes from non-generated groundwater due 
to scarcity of rainfall. However, the seawater desalination process consumes 
high energy with an adverse impact on marine and coastal ecosystems. 
Global sea levels could rise by 1-3 meters during this century according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Due to the nature of the 
low-lying coastal of Kuwait, it is at risk to sea levels rise associated with 
climate change. With a rise of (0.5 - 2 meters) at sea level. Kuwait could lose 
1.4 -3% of its coastal territory, which affects 5% of its GDP. 
 
Kuwait’s population reached 4411124 in 2016 with a steady increase over the 
past two decades by growth rate around 4.1%. The expected increase in 
population growth rate is combined with urban development and rapid 
provision of basic services to the population. In the light of the global decline 
in oil prices and the high cost of subsidies ratio in energy, water and housing 
prices, the State of Kuwait is facing many developmental challenges, 
including diversifying, and enhancing work opportunities that provides safe 
working environments for citizens and residents, urban planning and housing, 
infrastructure and promoting national capacities to monitor and implement 
developmental plans. 
 
Figure 1: Average annual temperature and precipitation

It is worth mentioning that the state of Kuwait is considered a country with a 
single source of income, it relies mainly on the extraction and sale of oil in its 
general budgets. Thus, the state's economy is vulnerable to oil prices 
fluctuations in supply and demand, and Kuwait's industrial base is based on 
the extraction, refining, and exporting of oil with an export revenue of more 
than 90% of the country total revenues, the value of the oil contribution to 
GDP represents 51-55%. Also, Kuwait is entirely dependent on fossil fuels 
for energy production by 83.5% of liquid oil and 16.5% of natural gas. 
(2) Distribution of greenhouse 
gas emissions: 
The State of Kuwait issued an 
update of its greenhouse gas 
emissions inventory for 2016. The 
total greenhouse gas emissions in 
2016 amounted to 86,336,448 
gigagrams of carbon dioxide, 
including 82,556.572 gigagrams of 
energy; 1,932,156 gigagrams of 
industrial processes and product 
use; 154,371 Gg of agriculture, 
13,932 Gg of forest and other land 
use and 1,706,539 Gg of waste. 
(Figure.2). 
Emissions of perfluorocarbons, 
hydrofluorocarbons and Sulphur 
hexafluoride in Kuwait are very 
small because products containing 
these gases are not produced in the 
country.  The (TIER-1) approach of 
the IPCC Guidelines was used in 
the calculations for all categories of 
reports, given that Kuwait does not have national emission factors and does 
not have detailed data to calculate the list of gases.  (Source: BUR- 2019). 
The energy sector is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, with 
energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 broken down by activity. 
Emissions from the production of electricity and desalinated water are mainly 
related to the combustion of natural gas, and petroleum products showed the 
 
Figure 2: Distribution of greenhouse gas 
emissions (Gigagrams), 2016 
 
8 
 
highest percentage of greenhouse 
gas emissions, about 58 percent.  
The contribution of pre-production 
and post-production activities in 
the oil and gas industry to total 
greenhouse gas emissions is about 
11%. Transportation activities are 
based largely on the use of 
gasoline 
and 
diesel 
oil 
and 
represent about 18% of the total 
emissions from energy-consuming 
activities. Fugitive emissions of 
methane, a gas with a high global 
warming potential, represent about 
9% 
of 
all 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions in the energy industries 
sector. Other combustion activities in manufacturing and construction 
accounted for the remaining 4%, (Figure.3). 
 
Second: contributions at the national level 
(1) avoiding of greenhouse gas emissions: 
 
The State of Kuwait is ambitious to move to a low carbon equivalent economy 
and to avoid the increase in greenhouse gas emissions compared to business 
as usual patterns, based on plans and development projects in the country for 
the period from 2015 to 2035, the state of Kuwait is seeking to achieve this 
objective on a voluntary basis by implementing some projects and enacting 
laws and legislation in the areas of mitigation and adapting to the adverse 
effect of climate change, which are mutually beneficial to mitigation. 
According to their national economic circumstances, and the state of Kuwait 
therefore seeks to avoid emission of greenhouse gases equivalent to 7.4% of 
its total future emission on 2035 through its national efforts. The State of 
Kuwait also hopes that financial technical and technological support will be 
provided through the mechanisms of the convention in particular market, non-
market mechanisms, and cooperative approach under article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement, to ensure the sustainability of future projects and to achieve 
greater benefit for emission reduction to implement future contribution.

(1.1) The projects of avoiding the increasing of emissions: 
The State of Kuwait seeks to avoid increasing greenhouse gases emissions 
from 2015 to 2035 based on business-as-usual patterns (BAU), by adopting 
the circular carbon economy principle in development projects and plans 
among the sectors most contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, the energy 
sector it represents 96% of the total state emissions, with a total state emission 
of 142290750 tons in 2035 and these projects are:

(2) Adapting with the adverse effects of climate change:   
The state of Kuwait seeks to move to a low-carbon economic system that is 
adoptable to the adverse effects of climate change to promote and protect its 
natural resources and achieve sustainable development standards, and it seeks 
to adapt to the effects of climate change from rising temperatures, scarce 
rainfall, rising sea levels, limited water sources, increasing intensity of dust 
storms and their impact on the economic, social and health sector.   
 (2.2) Adaptation projects: 
Fisheries sector: 
• The Environment Public Authority has established the electronic 
environmental control information system for the protection of marine 
life.   
• Establishment of a regional database and information center to support 
fisheries management (Food and Agriculture Organization UN/ The 
Public Authority of Agriculture Affairs and Fish Resources)   
• Creation of terrestrial and marine nature resources (EPA) 
  
Water resources Sector:  
• Development and implementation of water resources programs  
/ Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research.   
• Building desalination plants. 
• Rationalization of water consumption using modern techniques.   
• Definitions of collected water and water conservation.   
• Assessment of the technical needs of water resources.   
• Using wastewater that comes from wastewater processing stations. 
 
Coastal line Sector:   
• Establishment of the electronic environmental control information 
system for marine life in the state of Kuwait (EPA).   
• Establishment of the costal information system.   
• Coastal zone management program (EPA)  
  
Health Sector   
• Common Alerting Protocol (Meteoritical Public Administration)  
 
 
 
 
 
11 
 
 
 Third: Legislation and Laws: 
1-Emission limitation legislation and laws:  
The State of Kuwait has initiated formal producers to study the law of removal 
of subsidies for gasoline from the beginning of 2016 and gradual removal of 
subsidies for electricity and water in commercial and industrial sectors, and 
this contributes significantly to rationalization of greenhouse gas emission.   
The Kuwaiti National Assembly also adopted Environmental protection act 
no.42 of 2014, as amended by act no.99 of 2015, the aim of this act is to 
protect the environment and all its sources, controlling pollution, developing 
the natural resources, protecting the society and the human health and all 
living creatures. The act consists of 181 articles dealing with all issues relating 
to the protection of the earth, costal, and air environments from pollution, the 
biological diversity, penalties and environmental damages amends, and any 
related general law. 
 
The Environmental Protection Law 42/2014 deals directly and indirectly with 
the energy sector. Article (122) and (123) of the Environmental Protection 
Law stated the necessity of using energy-saving systems in the new state 
facilities. The law also prohibited the import of any devices or equipment that 
do not match with energy saving specification. 
 
The Environmental Protection Law in Article (111) urged the relevant state 
authorities to develop environmental strategies, plans and work programs 
related to the scope of their work.  
 
The articles of the law show the state’s interest and direction in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector by seeking to improve energy 
consumption management by establishing systems and rules for the efficiency 
of the devices used and the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings 
(building materials and design, air conditioning systems and lighting, etc.). 
 
The environmental law also paves the way for the development, adoption, and 
implementation of a national strategy to reduce the state’s consumption of 
energy and diversify energy sources, especially increasing the percentage of 
clean energies, in order to achieve the vision of His Highness the late Amir of 
the State of Kuwait, where His Highness announced the State of Kuwait’s 
endeavor to increase its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2030. 
 
 
 
12 
 
 
2- Legislation and laws adapting to the negative effects of climate 
changes: 
The Environmental Protection Law No. 42 of 2014 and its amendments 
accorded paramount importance in some of its articles to issues related to 
adapting to the negative effects of climate change, as it regulated the ways of 
using and consuming natural resources in the field of protecting the land. 
Articles (40) and (41) of the law discussed regulating the camping process 
and land use in grazing or any other activities that may harm the soil, which 
contributes to reducing the phenomenon of desertification and soil 
vulnerability. In addition, articles (102) and (103) are specified for managing 
natural reserves to maintain biodiversity. Regarding water resources 
management Articles (88) and (89) have set the foundations to develop a 
program for water management in the country and the standards, regulations 
for water conservation to adapt to the scarcity of water resources in the 
country. To adapt to the expected rise in sea level and its impact on the coasts 
of the country articles (66) and (99) of the Law are dedicated for the marine 
environment and the need to create a national network for monitoring and 
regulating the marine environment and conducting studies to monitor sea 
level rise. Considering that the State of Kuwait suffers from numerous crises 
and natural disasters such as sand and dust storms and flash floods waves, the 
law established Article (118), which states the needs to prepare emergency 
plans and crises and natural disasters management plans. 
Regarding food security, the state has issued laws related to entirely prevent 
fishing in Kuwait’s bay to maintain biodiversity and fish stocks. Furthermore, 
there are laws specialized in banning fishing of some species of fish and 
shrimp in the territorial waters and allows it only in specified seasons to 
prevent the depletion of fish stocks.  
The legislator also seeks through the Environment Protection Law No. 
42/2014, as amended some of its provisions in Law No. 99/2015 to promote 
environmental culture in Kuwait society and spread information relating to 
the environment for public to change some the behavioral patterns among the 
citizens and residents to increase public awareness with the concept of natural 
resources sustainability and the proper usage of it.

Fourth: The process of planning and implementation: 
For the state of Kuwait to be able to implement the procedures of mitigating 
greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change impacts and achieve 
sustainable development criteria, Kuwait needs the availability of 
technological and financial support and build national capacities from centers, 
committees and mechanisms included in the framework agreement such as 
technological mechanisms consisting of the Technology Executive 
Committee (TEC) and the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN), 
as well as the Green Climate Fund (GCF).  In accordance with provisions of 
Article (4.7) of the Framework Convention which states that the extent to 
which the developing countries fulfill its obligations under the Convention 
will depend on the developed party’s providence of support to developing 
parties in the field of finance, technology transfer, to ensure an effective 
global cooperative action on climate change. 
The State of Kuwait will start preparing a low-emissions development 
strategy 2050 in accordance with the requirements of the Paris climate 
agreement, based on the principle of a circular carbon economy.  And the state 
of Kuwait seeks to combine the outputs of this strategy with the new 
developing plans by endorsing new projects to serve the Kuwait vision 2035 
until 2050. 
Fifth: fairness and ambition: 
The state of Kuwait assigns great importance to international efforts that deal 
with global warming and believe that addressing this phenomenon is a 
common but differentiated responsibility among the countries of the world. 
Therefore, the State of Kuwait is keen on increasing its capacity in dealing 
with issues related to climate change simultaneously with its efforts in 
adapting with the negative impacts of this phenomenon and its consequences 
on the social and economic aspects. 
Although it did not participate in causing this phenomenon, the geographical 
location of the State of Kuwait made it vulnerable to the effects of climate 
change, which appeared to be very apparent in recent years through a 
significant rise in temperatures, the scarcity of rain, and the increase in dust 
and dust storms that cause life in the country to stop and damage the public 
 
14 
 
health of citizens. And residents, which contributes to increasing losses and 
economic burdens on the state, in addition to the possibility of the state losing 
parts of its coastal zone because of rising sea levels 1.4-3% of its coastal lands, 
affecting 5% of its GDP. 
The State of Kuwait will suffer from economic and social consequences of 
negative impacts of response measures, where Kuwait is considered one of 
the countries that its economy dependent on oil and will be affected negatively 
from international policies and procedures of the UNFCCC. The Secretariat 
of OPEC as well as many international consultancy entities have prepared 
several studies indicating in its wholeness that because of the intensive focus 
on fossil fuel sectors, particularly oil and oil products. 
Given the national circumstances of the state of Kuwait, which is currently 
facing numerous economic, social, and environmental challenges because of 
the outbreak of the corona pandemic during the past two years in addition to 
the growing population and the increasing demand of resources, particularly 
water and energy, which is accompanied with the decline in the national 
income because of mitigation policies of developed countries. Also taking 
into consideration the state's responsibility to provide employment 
opportunities, housing and to maintain the citizen's living standard, the 
contribution of the State of Kuwait determined at the national level to avoid 
the equivalent of 7.4% of its emissions on 2035 is considered very ambitious 
and fair. 
Sixth: General observations and assumptions: 
The State of Kuwait provided an update of its Nationally Determined 
Contributions for the period from 2015 to 2035, as information was extracted 
from the latest documents submitted by the State of Kuwait to the Secretariat 
of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
represented in the second national communication (SNC) July 2019, the first 
Biennial update report (BUR) September 2019, and the national Adaptation 
plan (NAP) February 2021. 
The update of the first contribution document has been prepared based on the 
development projects and plans of the country and based on the principle of 
the circular carbon economy, which achieves cooperation between the 
 
15 
 
government sector and the private sector in the country. The State of Kuwait 
is also counting on market, non-market mechanisms and cooperative 
Approach within Article six of the Paris Agreement to achieve greater 
ambition in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and including them in the 
upcoming national contributions, in addition to the means of implementation 
(financial and technical support and capacity building). 
and its importance in enhancing the state’s ability to reduce emissions and 
adapt to their negative effects on the country’s main sectors, and the State of 
Kuwait reserves the right to reconsider this document based on future 
developments related to national conditions and the state’s general policy, or 
in the event that the agreement or decisions of the relevant conferences of the 
parties are amended in a manner that includes rules or provisions that differ 
with the assumptions under which this document was presented.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC)

(ii) 
Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures

and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Liechtenstein’s  
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) 
 
Submission of 22 April 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, UNFCCC 
The content of Liechtenstein’s INDC follows the guidelines established by the 20th 
Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in December 2014 in Lima, Peru. Reference is 
made in particular to paragraphs 13 and 14 of 1/CP.201.  
1. 
Summary 
The assumptions underlying Liechtenstein’s INDC are based on the possibility to achieve 
emission reductions abroad which may be accounted towards Liechtenstein’s reduction 
target in 2030.2 However, primary focus will be given on domestic emission reductions. 
Liechtenstein aims at a reduction of greenhouse gases by 40 % compared to 1990 by 2030. 
The reduction target will be subject to the approval of the Liechtenstein Parliament.

National Circumstances 
With a population of 37’100 inhabitants and a total area of only 160 km2, Liechtenstein is 
one of the smallest countries in the world. Within 50 years Liechtenstein developed from 
a mainly agricultural state to one of the most highly industrialized countries in the world. 
The high value-added development until today is particularly due to the strong industrial 
sector and financial services, while the public sector of the national economy is

comparatively small. From 1990 until 2012 the country’s GDP experienced a growth of 
about 140 %, with an increase of population of around 25 %. At the same time 
Liechtenstein managed to decouple its economic growth from its greenhouse gas 
emissions. Despite the growth of its economy, the increase in population and commuters 
Liechtenstein’s emissions are today below the levels of 1990. 
 
Figure 1: Trend from 1990-2012 of resident population, employed persons and commuters in Liechtenstein 
as well GDP and greenhouse gas emissions in percent to 1990.3  
 
The decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth is the consequence of 
the establishment of rigorous environmental standards and a comprehensive set of 
climate related policy measures such as the participation in the European Emissions 
Trading regime, levying of CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels or the 
obligation to compensate emissions caused by motor fuel consumption.

Ex ante information according to paragraph 14 of 1/CP.20  
3.1 
Quantifiable information on the reference point 
For its reduction target Liechtenstein will apply 1990 as base year. The quantified amount 
of emissions in 1990 is currently considered to be 228.7 Kt CO2 eq4. This figure is however 
provisional since the 1990 value will be fixed once the respective initial report is defined. 
3.2 
Time frame for implementation and scope and coverage 
Liechtenstein’s INDCs encompass a reduction target within a time frame from 2021 until 
2030. The scope of Liechtenstein INDCs covers all sectors relevant to the state’s 
greenhouse gas emissions. The respective sectors and subsectors are based on the most 
recent IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Energy, Industrial 
Processes, Solvent Use, Agriculture, LULUCF and Waste.  
Liechtenstein’s INDCs cover seven greenhouse gases (as foreseen under the UNFCCC and 
the Kyoto Protocol) and generally apply the base year 19905: carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), 
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). 
 
3.3 
Planning Processes 
The planning processes for Liechtenstein encompass the sectors mentioned above under 
3.2. These sectors are addressed by individual sectorial policies which are guided by 
Liechtenstein’s climate strategy which will be revised in the course of 2015/2016. The 
strategy requires an interdisciplinary coordination of the focussed areas.  
The focus will be on the coordination of climate relevant measures within Liechtenstein’s 
energy policy, transport policy, environmental policy, agricultural and forestry policy.  
In addition to that the relevant CO2-Act will be revised in the course of 2016 / 2017 to 
reflect the targets for 2030. The EU energy and climate policies will also contribute to 
reach Liechtenstein’s goal within the energy sector on the long run. Within these policy 
areas Liechtenstein’s influence is very limited.

Assumptions and methodological approaches 
The assumptions underlying Liechtenstein’s INDC are based on the possibility to achieve 
emission reductions abroad which may be accounted towards Liechtenstein’s reduction 
target in 2030.6 However, primary focus will be given on domestic emission reductions. 
The methodological approaches for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic green-
house gas emissions and removals use standard methods. The emissions in Liechtenstein 
are calculated based on the standard methods and procedures of the Revised 1996 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories (IPCC 1997a, 1997b, 1997c) and IPCC Good Practice Guidance (IPCC 2000, 
IPCC 2003) as adopted by the UNFCCC.  
 
5. 
Fairness and ambition 
Liechtenstein understands fairness of its INDC within the context of national 
circumstances. As Liechtenstein is one of the smallest countries in the world its total 
emissions count up to 0.0073 % of the global total emissions. Liechtenstein’s responsibility 
in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is insignificantly low. Nevertheless per capita 
emissions of 6.1 tonnes in Liechtenstein lie within the European average. The overall 
reduction target of 40 % compared to 1990 corresponds to per capita emissions of 3.6 
CO2eq. The reduction path is considered to be very ambitious taking into account the 
already existing very high technical environmental standards applied in Liechtenstein. 
Moreover the reduction path is well in line with the respective recommendations made by 
the IPCC in 2014.  
Liechtenstein stays committed to deliver its fair share within the international efforts to 
combat climate change.  
 
                                                      
6 To this regard Liechtenstein reserves the right to revisit its overall commitment if no internationally agreed rules are given.

6. 
Contribution to the objective described in Art. 2 of the 
UNFCCC 
Liechtenstein’s main focus for its contribution, towards achieving the objective of the 
Convention as set out in its Article 2, is to reduce domestic emissions as much as possible. 
Albeit Liechtenstein is already highly efficient in its energy use some costs for further 
reductions within the country would be unreasonably high. Therefore Liechtenstein aims 
at the supplemental realization of emission reductions abroad. To that respect 
Liechtenstein emphasizes to invest in emission reduction projects of high quality 
standards which besides the mitigation of greenhouse gases also lead to social, health and 
environmental benefits. Liechtenstein is of the view that encompassing domestic emission 
reductions as well as emission reductions achieved abroad by its INDC states the most 
effective contribution to the objective described in Art. 2 of the UNFCCC.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies. 
(c) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 3, of the Paris 
Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a 
(d) 
How the Party has addressed Article 4, paragraph 4, of the Paris 
Agreement 
The EU complies with this provision by having an economy-wide absolute

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

III. INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR CLARITY, TRANSPARENCY AND 
UNDERSTANDING (ICTU)   OF THE EU’s NDC 
30.

The content of the EU NDC has been based on an extensive impact 
assessment3, as well as stakeholder input, collected via public consultation4. 
 
The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender 
equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: 
the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

(b) 
Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France 
47,5%, Croatia 16,7%, Italy 43,7%, Cyprus 32%, Latvia 17%,

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows:

limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

9ANNEX I
ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION ON MALAYSIA’S ADAPTATION STRATEGIES
1. The implementation of climate change adaptation in Malaysia focuses on the
management of water resources and security, coastal resources, agriculture and
food supply, urban and infrastructure resilience, public health, forestry and
biodiversity and key adaptation cross sectoral areas. Based on the downscaled
IPCC AR5 scenarios, projections of the future changes indicate that the rise of the
average annual surface temperature will range from 1.9 to 2.1°C by the end of the
century. The magnitude of change of average annual precipitation is expected to
range from 14% to 25%, while the sea levels are projected to continue rising about
0.73 meter by the end of the 21st century.
2. In the Eleventh Malaysia Plan (2016-2020), RM7.24 billion was allocated for
implementation to enhance climate-resilience and adaptation measures, and
continuous support will be emphasised in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (2021-2025).
Malaysia is also developing the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to ensure that
climate change adaptation is mainstreamed into its development plan.
Management of Water Resources and Security
3. The climate change phenomenon poses challenges to Malaysia’s water resources
management and security. In this regard the Ministry of Environment and Water is
responsible to ensure the sustainability of water resource management in
Malaysia.
4. The Integrated Water Resources Management is strengthened with the
implementation of the Integrated River Basin Management and Integrated Flood
Management to ensure efficient water management. Emphasis will be given
through gazettement of more forest water catchments to secure adequate and
safe water supply.
5. Minimizing flood impacts by incorporating climate change factors into flood risk
assessment and protection projects are important for Malaysia. In this regard,
weather-flood forecasting and early warning system based on future climate
conditions will be improved.
6. Malaysia continues to ensure water security against the impact of prolonged dry
spell by increasing water supply reserve margin with the reduction of non-revenue
water and implementation of the off-river storage structural forms. Malaysia plans
to increase diversification and exploration of alternative water sources such as
urban scale rainwater harvesting system, groundwater, recycled and reclaimed
water for conjunctive use. Prioritisation of water demand management to reduce
stress on water supply is high on the agenda.
7. These strategies are incorporated in the development of the Water Sector
Transformation 2040. In the transformation, finance and technology are part of the
strategies and implementation.
10Protecting Coastal Resources
8. Sea level rise (SLR) poses threat to Malaysia’s coastal resources. SLR and storm
surge projections will be mainstreamed into the Integrated Shoreline Management
Plan and for the planning of coastal protection and development projects.
9. Malaysia utilises the Coastal Vulnerability Index associated with SLR, as an
essential indicator to evaluate the vulnerability and risk levels of shoreline. This
will be embedded in mapping out vulnerability assessment of different socio-
economic segments. Efforts will be focused on intensification of developing
coastline SLR-based inundation maps.
10. Malaysia focuses on increasing coastal resilience against the impacts of SLR and
management of storm surge impacted areas through rehabilitation and protection
programs. Adoption of nature-based solutions and green-gray infrastructures will
be continuously promoted.
Securing Agriculture and Food Security in Malaysia
11. The changing of climate patterns also pose risks to the agriculture and food
security. Strategies will be implemented to increase the resilience and productivity
of climate-vulnerable crops. Crops resilience to climate change will also be
intensified through risk mapping and strategic pests and disease control
management.
12. Research will be carried out to increase climate-tolerant species and varieties.
These include augmenting the development of food crop types that can
accommodate the demands posed by climate change.
13. The conservation of more major granary areas and expansion of future inland and
coastal flood risk assessments on agricultural lands will be implemented to ensure
the efficiency of food productivity and raise the self-sufficiency levels. Good and
efficient agricultural practices will be further implemented in order to secure
continuous agriculture and food supply. These can be achieved through the
promotion of smart farming technologies and the implementation of diversification
and integrated management.
Increasing Resilience for Infrastructure and Cities
14. In managing future risks and potential loss from climate change, Malaysia is
mainstreaming climate resilience into urban planning and development of
infrastructures. This will include emphasising infrastructure integrity assessments
and revisions of the existing manuals and guidelines.
15. Future planning for waste and wastewater infrastructures will take into account its
sustainability, efficiency and effectiveness whilst avoiding areas that are
environmentally sensitive, flood-prone and categorised as water catchments.
Adopting nature-based solutions such as constructed wetlands in facilitating
wastewater treatments will be a priority.
1116. Malaysia also aims to identify, implement and expand innovative and nature-
based infrastructure design. Resilient and green city concept will be adopted to
ensure future climate risks are managed efficiently.
Improving Public Health Resilience
17. Malaysia will expand public health management of future climate risks by adopting
evidence-based decision making and improve the projection models in addressing
the complex causal relation pathway of climate change and health. Disease
management will adopt new models that utilises climatic data to predict changes
and impacts of climate-sensitive diseases.
18. In addition, efforts are undertaken to strengthen surveillance and early warning
systems to improve public health preparedness in predicting the future disease
impacts. This will be implemented by incorporating weather forecasts into risk
maps of climate-sensitive disease.
19. Critical healthcare facilities’ adaptive capacity will be increased through improving
resilience strategies, whilst sustaining essential functions and structures of the
public health systems.
Enhancing Adaptation for Forestry and Biodiversity
20. Increasing forest catchment capacity and enhancing management are needed to
accommodate expected increase runoff volume and peak flood flow due to higher
projected rainfall. It is also crucial to gazette more forest water catchment area in
order to maintain and sustain fundamental ecological functions, especially with
respect to infiltration rate and soil-water storage capacity.
21. Preservation of vulnerable terrestrial and marine ecosystem and expanding
protected areas, including fisheries zones within the marine and coastal protection
corridors will be given priority. The ability to manage terrestrial ecosystem is
essential and can be enhanced by increasing riparian area management units and
reserving larger buffer areas around wetlands, peat swamps and mangroves.
Moreover, efforts in establishing reserve to protect ecosystem diversity through
enhancing structural and species varieties are also needed.
Cross Sectoral Efforts: Managing Disaster Risk
22. Malaysia has ratified the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR)
2015-2030 on 18 March 2015 to reduce disaster risks and loss and damage for
better management of socio-economic and environmental impacts. Malaysia will
continue the efforts to strengthen the capacity and mechanism in disaster risk
management. The integration of climate change adaptation and disaster risk
reduction will be given the focus in the national development plan. Furthermore,
Malaysia will continue to be more inclusive and mainstream gender, youth and
vulnerable groups in adaptation and disaster risk reduction programs.
12Cross Sectoral Efforts: Climate Financing Support, Technology Transfer and
Capacity Building
23. Malaysia will continue the efforts to explore and optimise the financing
mechanism, technology needs assessment and capacity development for climate
change impacted sectors to enhance adaptive capacity. Successful
implementation of adaptation activities will increase investment and funds from
various sources including private sector.
Cross Sectoral Efforts: Establishment of Monitoring and Evaluation Mechanism
24. The Paris Agreement requires each Party to monitor, evaluate and learn from
adaptation planning, policies, programs, and actions. Currently, there is no
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanism or framework established for
adaptation. During the development of the National Adaptation Plan, the M&E
mechanism will be incorporated and established to ensure successful
implementation.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

MONGOLIA’S NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION  
TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
 
Overview of Mongolia’s Nationally Determined Contribution  
Mongolia has developed its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which was approved by the 
Government Decree No.407 of November 2019, with the aim to contribute to the Paris Agreement. 
In the NDC, Mongolia has enhanced its mitigation efforts with policies and measures to be 
implemented in key economic and natural resource management sectors by 2030.  
The mitigation target of Mongolia’s NDC will be a 22.7% reduction in total national greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by 2030 (Figure 1), compared to the projected emissions under a business as usual 
scenario for 2010. In addition, if conditional mitigation measures such as the carbon capture and 
storage and waste-to-energy technology are implemented, then Mongolia could achieve a 27.2% 
reduction in total national GHG emissions. Along with that, actions and measures to remove GHG 
emissions by forest are determined, which set the total mitigation target of Mongolia as 44.9% of 
GHG emission reduction by 2030.

In the development of this NDC, Mongolia re-calculated the baseline emissions up to 2030, which are 
estimated to reach 74.3 Mt СО2-eq. in 2030 without LULUCF, compared to 2015’s INDC baseline of 51.3 Mt 
СО2-eq. The difference between these baseline emissions is primarily due to a variance in the methodology 
applied for base year emission (Revised 1996 IPCC GLs for INDC and 2006 IPCC GLs for NDC), as well as 
increasing the number of livestock and additional policy plans in the industrial processing sector, e.g. coal 
gasification project. This NDC now includes sectors that were not previously considered such as agriculture, 
waste and some industrial sectors. Under the new baseline, the mitigation target is a 22.7% reduction in total 
national GHG emissions. Under the 2015 baseline and INDC, the mitigation target was a 14% reduction in total 
national GHG emissions excluding land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) by 2030. 
 
Adaptation needs and priorities are determined broadly in the NDC, considering the country specific 
vulnerabilities and climate risks for key socio-economic and natural resource management sectors. Moreover, 
there is an ongoing project (2018-2021) aimed to develop the national adaptation plan (NAP), and through 
this effort, the specific adaptation action will be identified. For the development of NAP, Mongolia is taking 
special consideration of the co-benefits between mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as on nature-based 
solutions in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of response measures to climate change.  
 
By 2030, Mongolia intends to contribute to global efforts to mitigate GHG emissions by implementing the 
policies and measures listed in Annex 1, facilitating continued international support to complement domestic 
efforts. The initial estimate of financial needs for this NDC implementation is around US$11.5 billion, of which 
US$6.3 billion for mitigation, and US$5.2 billion for adaptation.

Implementation and integration 
of NDC into the national 
development policy and 
strategies 
For the achievement of NDC targets, it is imperative to develop a 
national roadmap, which reflects all actions and measures along with 
guidelines for sectors and integrate these actions into the Government 
action program and the national budget.  
 
The integration of NDC targets into the development of policy 
documents is beneficial to mobilize climate finance and explore 
international cooperation and support.  
 
One of the advantages of the NDC is that the principle targets presented 
in the NDC are in line with the national development policy documents 
such as the Vision-2050, which covers the development framework 
reflected in the following documents: 
- Green development policy of Mongolia, 2014  
- National action program on climate change, 2011  
- Sustainable development vision-2030, 2016 
- State policy on the energy sector of Mongolia, 2015  
- State policy on food and agricultural sector, 2010  
- State policy on forest, 2015  
- Law on renewable energy, 2015 
- Law on energy, 2015 
- National program on energy saving, 2017 
 
These national strategy and policy documents, as well as relevant legal 
instruments define stakeholders’ responsibilities and monitoring 
structure for implementation of the NDC.

E. Needs for Support 
Financial Support 
The financial needs for the NDC implementation are estimated initially as 
US$11.5 billion, of which US$6.3 billion for mitigation, and US$5.2 billion for 
adaptation.  
Technology Transfer 
In order to solve problems, the focus has to be made on soft approaches rather 
than solely relying on hard ones, including indigenous knowledge of local 
communities, combining traditional practices with modern know-hows. 
For determining the most suitable, efficient, and effective technologies, 
Mongolia needs to conduct the technology needs assessment.  
Capacity Building and 
Knowledge Sharing 
 
Building capacities to disseminate and transfer scientific information and 
knowledge and educating the public and various stakeholders on climate 
change, its impacts, as well as potential mitigation and adaptation measures are 
an essential precondition for the successful implementation of Mongolia’s NDC.

Update of the NDC of Montenegro  
This submission consists of three parts: 1) Summary of procedural developments, 2) 
Summary of the Montenegro’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and 3) 
the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU) of 
the NDC.  
I. Summary of procedural developments    
Montenegro submitted their intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) in 
September 2015, in line with decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the 
Parties (COP) in Lima.  
The Montenegro’s INDC became its NDC when it ratified the Paris Agreement on December 
2017, with a target of 30% economy-wide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions - 
excluding the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector - by 2030, compared 
to 1990 levels.   
In 2021, the Montenegro endorsed a new and more ambitious target for 2030 of at least 
35% economy-wide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions - excluding the LULUCF sector 
- and submitted it to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 15 June 20211.   
With this submission, Montenegro updates information on its NDC with a more ambitious 
multi-year target for the timeframe 2025-2035 and a full coverage of the economy through 
the inclusion of the LULUCF sector. 
II. Update of Montenegro’s Nationally Determined Contribution 
(NDC)  
Montenegro is committed to a multi-year target of a domestic economic-wide reduction of 
net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 55% and 60% compared to 1990 by 2030 
and 2035 respectively. The scope of this commitment is net greenhouse gas emissions 
considering all sectors of the national GHG inventory.  
The NDC update process involved an integrated assessment of both current and projected 
GHG emissions, considering the impact of implemented, adopted, and planned policies and 
measures under a conservative economic development scenario. The assessment’s findings 
were reviewed and validated through a multi-stakeholder consultation process, ensuring 
broad alignment with national priorities. 
The NDC update process also aligns with the development of Montenegro’s National Energy 
and Climate Plan (NECP) under the Energy Community framework and supports the

February 2025  
 
 
 
 
country’s ongoing efforts as an EU candidate, preparing for accession to the European 
Union. Together with the update of the NDC with the 2030 and 2035 targets, the ambition 
of the previous NDC with its 2030 target has also been increased by including all IPCC 
sectors and increasing from 35% to 55% GHG emission reduction from 1990 levels. For 
these reasons, Montenegro’s updated NDC consists in a multi-year target with two 
implementation periods from 2025 to 2030 and from 2031 to 2035. 
Finally, Montenegro has updated its NDC taking into account all Rio Conventions through 
the assessment of the synergies of mitigation and adaptation policies and measures with 
key national strategies. These include: 1) the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan 
(NBSAP) under the Convention on Biological Diversity, which is consistent with the Aichi 
Biodiversity Targets and focused on adaptation to EU legislation and the Natura 2000 
network, as well as the cross-sectoral integration of biodiversity concerns; 2) the Voluntary 
Land Degradation Neutrality target, which incorporates relevant mitigation and adaptation 
measures and its linked to the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) developed in 2024 and 3) the 
promotion of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) for both mitigation and adaptation, aiming to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to deforestation and land use and increase the 
capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while enhancing resilience of ecosystems. 
In preparing the updated NDC, efforts were made to ensure coherence with these 
instruments by considering their overarching objectives, identifying synergies, and avoiding 
inconsistencies or duplication. This approach reflects best practices in policy integration, 
where alignment is achieved through the consistent application of shared priorities and 
frameworks across national planning processes.

4.               Planning processes 
4(a) 
Information on the planning processes that the Party 
undertook to prepare its nationally determined contribution 
and, if available, on the Party’s implementation plans, 
including, as appropriate:  
 
Montenegro operates under a parliamentary political system and is divided into 25 political-
territorial units known as municipalities, each responsible for local governance. 
In the process of updating the NDC previous, during and after the technical assessments, 
three rounds of consultations were organised before adoption of the NDC by the government 
with the following national partners and stakeholders:  
• 
The Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development, and Northern Development, in 
charge of climate governance with the Directorate for Climate Change and Sustainable 
developement playing a central role in policy adoption, implementation, and monitoring.  
• 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the same ministry, which plays a 
key role in establishing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and projections.  
• 
Ministry of Energy who is mandated to elaborate the National Energy and Climate 
Plan to achieve strategic goals by 2030 and transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050.  
• 
Institute of Hydrometeorology and Seismology that has competencies in meteorology, 
climatology, hydrology, hydrography, oceanography and seismology and is responsible for 
most of the physical climate data tracking and analysis of climate scenarios.  
• 
Ministry of Economic Development that oversees industrial policies, economic 
recovery programmes, and green economy development.  
• 
The Statistical office (MONSTAT), the municipalities and other sectoral line ministries 
such as Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water management, Ministry of Transport, 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
• 
The National Council for Sustainable Development (NSOR) in which members of the 
workforce are appointed from state administration authorities responsible for certain sectors, 
local administration, scientific, professional, public and other workers, employers' 
associations, representatives of civil society associations operating in the field of climate 
change, independent experts and youth representatives. NSOR’s working groups focus on 
areas such as policy implementation, climate change mitigation, just transition, and 
sustainable development at both local and national levels. 
The updated NDC is based on analysis of historic GHG emission trends, and an impact 
assessment of mainly existing mitigation measures. The updated NDC has been shared and 
discussed with stakeholders and comments have been taken into account. The updated NDC 
for both 2030 and 2035 targets has also been approved by the government and streamlined 
with the policies and measures of the integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP).  
February 2025   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Para 
Guidance provided by CMA 1 
ICTU applicable to the Montenegro’s NDC 
Different policies and measures have been set in the last decade, allowing Montenegro to 
develop and agree on its updated NDC commitment. Montenegro adopted a by-law allowing 
the country to participate in the EU ETS from 2025 onwards.  The Law on the Protection 
against the Negative Effects of Climate Change entered into force in 2019, mandating the 
development of a GHG inventory, a low-carbon development strategy, a national system of 
MRV and a national ETS covering emissions from the industrial and power sectors. The 2020 
Decree on activities that emit greenhouse gases for which a permit for the emission of 
greenhouse gases includes provisions for banking allowances. Additionally, Montenegro has 
adopted the 2021 Decree on aviation activities for which a monitoring plan is not submitted, a 
2021 Rulebook on the form of the permit for the GHG emissions, a 2021 Rulebook on the form, 
content and manner of verification of the report on GHG emissions and a 2022 Rulebook on the 
content of the plan for monitoring GHG emissions from the stationary plant and continues 
working in the establishment of a stable national system of carbon prices in accordance with 
EU policy requirements. 
 
(i) Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation 
and engagement with local communities and indigenous 
peoples, in a gender-responsive manner;  
The NDC is prepared in the context of Montenegro’s commitment to gender equality and 
cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: the commitment to create and 
maximise synergies between the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of 
sustainable development; integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality 
into the national plans and strategies; and the Montenegro’s support for adoption of the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
Montenegro aims to achieve gender-balanced participation and encourage the full, equal, 
effective and meaningful participation and leadership of women and youth at all levels of 
climate action and decision making.  
The country will also continue to support their meaningful engagement in climate change 
decision-making processes, as well as climate education and training, and increase public 
awareness on climate change.  
Montenegro welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights Council and General 
Assembly that the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is a human right and 
will actively engage in discussions advancing this right and promote inclusion and non-
discrimination.

a. National circumstances, such as geography, climate, 
economy, sustainable development and poverty eradication; 
b. Best practices and experience related to the preparation of 
the nationally determined contribution;  
c. Other contextual aspirations and priorities acknowledged 
when joining the Paris Agreement;  
its natural beauty. The country is situated at the crossroads of two major geographical 
formations—the Dinaric Alps (Dinarides) and the Central Mediterranean—which results in a 
diverse and dynamic landscape. Covering an area of 13,812 km², Montenegro boasts a rich 
geological foundation, varied landscapes, diverse soils, and multiple climate zones, as 
recognized by the Convention on Biological Diversity. The country can be broadly divided into 
two main biogeographical regions: the Mediterranean and the Alpine, each hosting a wide range 
of ecosystems. Montenegro's water systems are split between two major drainage basins: the 
Adriatic Sea Basin and the Black Sea Basin. The Adriatic Basin is dominated by the Morača and 
Bojana rivers, with Lake Skadar serving as a vital freshwater resource. Meanwhile, the Black 
Sea Basin is drained by rivers such as the Tara, Lim, and Piva, which flow toward the Danube 
via the Drina River. 
 
Hydropower is the country’s most important energy resource and Montenegro is ranked high 
in terms of availability of hydropower resources. However, environmental protection 
requirements and seismic risks reduce its utilization. Montenegro is a service-based economy. 
The energy sector, comprising energy supply and consumption in the transport, residential 
and service sectors, has the highest share of 2022 net GHG emissions (45%) followed by 
LULUCF (41%), waste (6%), agriculture (4%) and IPPU (3%)2. Most of the energy industry 
emissions comes from the thermal power plant (TPP) Pljevlja which is the only coal-fired 
power station in Montenegro into service since 1982 with a generation capacity of 225 MW 
and produces a third of the country's electricity. Forests cover around 70% of Montenegro’s 
land area and represent a net sink.  
Montenegro has a number of instruments and initiatives directed at various aspects of green 
economy. The main driver behind the strengthening of climate policy and legislation has been 
the process of accession to the EU.  
Montenegro is among the group of UN member countries which have officially adopted a 
National Strategy for Sustainable Development until 2030, which follows the UN Agenda 
2030. 
The development of Montenegro’s NDC represents a good practice in integrating national 
priorities for a country aspiring to join a regional bloc such as the European Union. The NDC 
has been prepared with careful consideration of Montenegro’s priorities as an EU accession

country, while also reflecting its national circumstances as a developing country. Drawing 
inspiration from the EU experience and following ICTU guidance, Montenegro’s NDC focuses 
on the country’s mitigation contributions, while a separate submission has been prepared for 
adaptation. This approach highlights the critical importance of adaptation for Montenegro, 
aligning with both international reporting requirements and best practices within the EU.”

Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional 
economic integration organizations and their member States, 
that have reached an agreement to act jointly under Article 4, 
paragraph 2, of the Paris Agreement, including the Parties 
that agreed to act jointly and the terms of the agreement, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of the Paris 
Agreement;  
The updated NDC targets for 2030 and 2035 will be fulfilled by Montenegro and is not part of 
regional joint agreement. 
In 2007, Montenegro accessed the Energy Community Treaty (ECT), which allows the country 
to be an active member of the Regional and European Energy Market, obliging the state to 
align its national energy and climate related legislation with the community acquis.  
Montenegro is a candidate country to the EU and is currently implementing negotiation 
chapter 27 on ’Environment and Climate Change’. The chapter has been opened in December 
2018. Further efforts are being set up to align with the EU2030 climate and energy policy 
framework. 
A National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), as mandated by the EU Governance Regulation (EU 
2018/1999), has been developed in alignment with the current NDC. While the NECP does not 
establish specific mitigation targets, it serves as a strategic framework for climate and energy 
policies, supporting the fulfilment of national commitments made prior to this NDC submission. 
In this context, this NDC submission and the NECP remain aligned in their policies and 
measures, technical assumptions, and national approaches to mitigation.

How the Party’s preparation of its nationally determined 
contribution has been informed by the outcomes of the global 
stocktake, in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9, of the 
Paris Agreement;  
Montenegro participated in the Talanoa Dialogue during the COP24 in 2018 dedicated to raise 
global awareness for the necessary enhancement of NDCs by 2020. According to Article 14.2 
of the Paris Agreement, the Conference serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Agreement 
(CMA) shall undertake its first global stocktake in 2023 and every 5 years thereafter unless

cover, but are not limited to, sectors such as manufacturing 
and industry, energy and mining, transport and 
communication, construction, tourism, real estate, agriculture 
and fisheries.  
5. Assumptions and methodological approaches 
5(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA;  
Montenegro’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with methodologies and 
common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), below).  
Montenegro has updated its GHG Emission Inventory and performed recalculations to 
improve the quality of the resulting estimates. 
Consistent methodologies have been applied throughout the reported period (1990-2022), 
efforts have been made to apply country specific data and moving to higher Tier methods, 
and accuracy and completeness was increased – especially in the LULUCF sector. 
The accounting guidance included in Annex II of decision 4/CMA.1 has been used for 
accounting of anthropogenic emissions and removals. 
5(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for the implementation of policies and measures or 
strategies in the nationally determined contribution;  
Three GHG scenarios were developed to inform the NDC of Montenegro: a Without Measures 
Scenario, a With Measures Scenario and a With Additional Measures scenario. These scenarios 
considered the impact of policies and measures in the future GHG emissions of the country. 
The scenarios were estimated from the latest GHG emission inventory available (1990-2022), 
in line with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and ensuring methodological consistency between the 
inventory, projections and policies and measures (PAMs).  The PAMs considered in each 
scenario are listed below. Under the With Existing Measures (WEM) scenario, the following 
measures are included: ecological refurbishment of the Pljevlja Thermoelectric Power Plant

(TPP), carbon pricing for TPP, NDC renewable power plants and new renewable capacity, 
district heating in Pljevlja, development and implementation of an energy efficiency regulatory 
framework for buildings, increased energy efficiency in public buildings, financial incentives for 
citizens and private households to invest in energy efficiency, energy labeling and eco-design 
requirements for energy-related products, establishment and implementation of energy 
efficiency criteria in public tendering, implementation of energy efficiency measures in public 
municipal companies, utilities, and services, development of transmission and distribution 
networks to reduce losses, refurbishment of small hydroelectric power plants to enhance 
efficiency, promotion of electric vehicles, financial incentives for electric, plug-in hybrid, and 
full hybrid vehicles for both citizens and businesses, reduction of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in 
line with the Law on Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the 
Ozone Layer, reduction of bio-waste in municipal waste, and an increase in the sewerage 
system connection rate, targeting 93% by 2035. 
 
Under the With Additional Measures (WAM) scenario, additional policies and measures are 
considered, aligned with relevant EU legislation. These include industrial decarbonization, in 
line with the EU ETS and the Industrial Emissions Directive; sustainable transport, following 
CO₂ emission standards for vehicles, the Fit for 55 Package, and the Alternative Fuels 
Infrastructure Regulation; green buildings and enhanced energy efficiency, in accordance with 
the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), 
and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED); sustainable agriculture, as outlined in the Effort 
Sharing Regulation (ESR) and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); low-carbon refrigerants, 
aligned with the EU F-Gas Regulation; and enhanced waste management and circular economy 
measures, following the Landfill Directive, the EU Waste Framework Directive, and the Circular 
Economy Action Plan and the LULUCF Regulation. 
 
The scenarios developed are consistent with those reported in Montenegro’s first Biennial 
Transparency Report (BTR) as they were developed by the same team following the same 
methodologies and approaches, with the major exception that the NDC scenarios include the 
Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. It should be noted that the 
estimated scenarios informed the decision on Montenegro’s NDC target; however, they do not 
constitute a commitment to the implementation of specific PAMs.

The PAMs for the implementation of the NDC will be further developed in the national policy 
framework as required. The accounting of policies and measures will be developed and 
monitored against the national GHG inventory, following the principles and good practices of 
IPCC Guidelines, and in line with the Modalities, Procedures and Guidelines of the Enhanced 
Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement.

If applicable, information on how the Party will take into 
account existing methods and guidance under the Convention 
to account for anthropogenic emissions and removals, in

Agreement, as appropriate; 
Not applicable.  
Montenegro’s NDC is an absolute, economy-wide net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  
See 5 (d), below.  
 
5(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals;  
Montenegro’s approach has been developed in accordance with the 2006  IPCC guidelines for 
GHG inventories, consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. Decision 5/CMA.3 also allows Parties to 
use the 2019 IPCC refinement on a voluntary basis and Montenegro has started using the 
refinement when it better reflects the national circumstances and improves the quality of the 
resulting estimates. 
The GHG emission inventory used to set the updated NDC is in compliance with the 2006 
IPCC  Guidelines and its 2019 Refinement.  
The Metrics used are the Global Warming Potentials on a 100 timescale in accordance with 
IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report (AR5).  
5(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, 
methodologies and approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, 
as appropriate, including, as applicable:

from natural disturbances on managed lands;  
(ii) Approach used to account for emissions and removals from 
harvested wood products;  
(iii) Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure 
in forests;  
Assumptions and approaches applicable to the LULUCF sector as a whole: the LULUCF sector 
emissions and removals estimates build on IPCC guidance, TACCC principles and existing 
accounting rules. 
The target is accounted against the net GHG removals (emissions) occurring for:  
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported categories of forest land, 
cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other land, harvested wood products, other, 
atmospheric deposition and nitrogen leaching and run-off, including land use change between 
these categories.   
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in mineral soils; Soil 
organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood products. 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O. 
Variations on the carbon stock in forest is estimated based on the information of the 
Montenegro’s National Forest Inventory (NFI).

Living biomass increase has been estimated using increment data from the NFI. While there 
has only been one inventory cycle so far, increment estimates were derived based on 
increment borer measurements of sample trees.  
The following provides information relative to items i, ii and iii of paragraph 5(e): 
i) Emissions and removals are estimated using 2006 IPCC Guidelines without any special 
approach to exclude emissions or removals due to natural disturbances. 
ii) Harvested Wood Products are estimated based on the production approach (or approach 
B) of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Activity data have been derived from the FAOStat database on 
forestry production and trade statistics. 
iii) Age classes are taken into account implicitly in the estimation of the growth rates of the 
different species. 
5(f) 
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including:  
(i) How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference 
level(s), including, where applicable, sector-, category- or 
activity-specific reference levels, are constructed, including, for 
example, key parameters, assumptions, definitions, 
methodologies, data sources and models used;  
(ii) For Parties with nationally determined contributions that 
contain non-greenhouse-gas components, information on 
assumptions and methodological approaches used in relation 
to those components, as applicable;  
(iii) For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated;  
(iv) Further technical information, as necessary;  
(i) 
Not applicable. See 5(b) above. The NDC target is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse 
gas emissions reduction target.

The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of 
the Paris Agreement, if applicable.  
The accounting rules for international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement 
have not been set yet. Montenegro has not made any national decision on this issue yet but is 
striving to participate in the EU emission trading scheme from 2025 onwards.

Para 
Guidance provided by CMA 1 
ICTU applicable to the Montenegro’s NDC 
6(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances;  
Montenegro’s at least 55% and 60% net reduction target by 2030 and 2035 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international credits.  
Montenegro’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it takes into account the country specific 
national circumstances and emission reduction potential as well as the efforts made to date. 
The NDC submitted by Montenegro is fair and ambitious because it aims to secure significant 
reduction of its GHG emissions while satisfying the country’s need for economic development, 
allowing a feasible pathway for long-term decarbonisation.  
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas emissions need to fall by 
about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The 
Montenegro’s “at least -55% and 60%” multi-year target is consistent with this level of 
reduction, building on the substantial emissions reductions achieved since the base year 
1990.  
It should also be noted that Montenegro has already reduced net GHG emissions to 71.6% 
below 1990 levels in 2022, while emissions have risen by over 50% worldwide.  
In addition, Montenegro is on track on substantially exceeding its previous 2030 target.  
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to the previous NDC for the same 
timeframe. 
Montenegro is a developing country, highly vulnerable to the effects of the climate change.  
National GHG emissions represent only 0,002 % of global emissions (source: Edgar database, 
Join Research Centre) and the net per capita GHG emissions in Montenegro amounted in 2022 
to 1.63 t CO2eq while in the EU27 this is 7.84 tCO2 eq per capita (source: Edgar database, Join 
Research Centre).  
Montenegro is committed to decouple GHG emissions from its economic growth and embark 
on a low emission development pathway. 
Regarding the costs of implementation, the mitigation effort required for Montenegro to achieve 
its NDC targets for 2030 and 2035 is estimated at €1,566,761,634. Additionally, the 
implementation of further policies and measures needed for EU accession by 2035, beyond the 
previously stated amount, is estimated at €1,258,683,319. 
6(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity;  
Montenegro considers its update of the NDC from -35% compared to 1990 excluding LULUCF, 
to -55% in 2030 including LULUCF and -60% compared to 1990 to be achieved in 2035 
ambitious and fair, as the country will have to ensure the implementation of mitigation 
measures, which require substantial investments, as well as mechanisms and awareness 
raising to ensure a just transition.

1. Introduction
Nepal is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is at high-risk due to
the country’s fragile topography, the climate-sensitive livelihoods of the people and their
limited adaptive capacity. Nepal is committed to acting on climate change in line with
the Paris Agreement, despite the country’s negligible emissions. It is because efforts to
limit global average temperature rise to 1.5°C would result in significantly lower risks for
Nepal when compared to 2°C or higher. These risks are in addition to the existing
impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change in the country. Nepal, therefore, calls on
all Parties to increase ambition and move collectively onto emission reduction pathways
consistent with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C warming limit.
The Government of Nepal hereby presents its enhanced Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement for the period 2021-2030, following
Articles 4.2 and 4.11 of the Paris Agreement, and Decision 1/CP.21 paragraph 23 and
24, and other relevant provisions of the Paris Agreement. The NDC takes into account
the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in
light of national circumstances.
2. Nepal's Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emission Development Strategy
Nepal envisions achieving socio-economic prosperity by building a climate-resilient
society. To this end, the country has developed its policy and institutional framework. In
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19 of the Paris Agreement, Nepal is formulating a
long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy by 2021. The strategy
aims to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050.
3. Mitigation Component of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
Quantified targets of NDC
Type Activity-based targets and policy targets in key sectors, including
emissions reduction in some sectors
1The targets in this section, unless otherwise specified, are conditional
upon international support.
Coverage Energy; Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU); Agriculture,
Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU); and Waste
Timeframe From 1st January 2021- 31st December 2030
Single year target – 2030, including updates on 2025 targets
Energy (Energy generation)
 By 2030, expand clean energy generation from approximately
1,400 MW to 15,000 MW, of which 5-10 % will be generated
from mini and micro-hydro power, solar, wind and bio-energy. Of
this, 5,000 MW is an unconditional target. The remainder is
dependent upon the provision of funding by the international
community.
 By 2030, ensure 15% of the total energy demand is supplied
from clean energy sources.
(Transport)
 Sales of electric vehicles (e-vehicles) in 2025 will be 25% of all
private passenger vehicles sales, including two-wheelers and
20% of all four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales (this
public passenger target does not take into account electric-
rickshaws and electric-tempos) in 2025. Due to this e-vehicle
sales target, fossil fuel energy demand for the transportation
sector will decrease from approximately 40 million GJ in the
Business As Usual (BAU) scenario in 2025 to 36 million GJ. This
would be around a 9% decrease in fossil fuel dependency. This
target will reduce emissions from a projected BAU of 2,988 Gg
CO eq. in 2025 to 2,734 Gg CO eq., which is around 8%
2 2
decrease in emissions.
 By 2030, increase sales of e-vehicles to cover 90% of all private
passenger vehicle sales, including two-wheelers and 60% of all
four-wheeler public passenger vehicle sales (the public
passenger target does not take into account electric-rickshaws
and electric-tempos). As a consequence, energy demand for
fossil fuels will decrease from approximately 48 million GJ in the
2030 BAU scenario to 34.5 million GJ, which is around 28%
decrease in fossil fuel dependency. This target will reduce
emissions from a projected BAU of 3,640 Gg CO eq. in 2030 to
2
2,619 Gg CO eq., which is around 28% decrease in emissions.
2
 By 2030, develop 200 km of the electric rail network to support
public commuting and mass transportation of goods.
2(Residential cooking and biogas)
 By 2030, ensure 25% of households use electric stoves as their
primary mode of cooking.
 By 2025, install 500,000 improved cookstoves, specifically in
rural areas.
 By 2025, install an additional 200,000 household biogas plants
and 500 large scale biogas plants (institutional/industrial/
municipal/community).
These three combined targets can reduce emissions from
approximately 1,999 Gg CO eq. in BAU in 2025 to approximately
2
1,774 Gg CO eq. This is around 11% reduction in emissions from
2
the cooking sector. For 2030, these three targets can reduce
emissions from approximately 2,064 Gg CO eq. from BAU to 1,599
2
Gg CO eq., which is around 23% reduction in emissions.
2
AFOLU (Forestry)
 By 2030, maintain 45% of the total area of the country under
forest cover (including other wooded land limited to less than
4%).
 By 2030, manage 50% of Tarai and Inner Tarai forests and 25%
of middle hills and mountain forests sustainably, including
through the use of funding from REDD+ initiatives.
Waste  By 2025, 380 million litres/day of wastewater will be treated
before being discharged, and 60,000 cubic meters/year of faecal
sludge will be managed. These two activities will reduce around
258 Gg CO eq. compared to BAU.

NDC and, if available, on the Party’s implementation plans, including, as appropriate:
The NDC was developed through an inclusive and
participatory process, with a series of consultations at
national and provincial levels.
Nepal’s NDC formulation was a country-driven process
following the principle of Leave No One Behind (LNOB).
A team of experts reviewed overarching and sectoral

gender- consultations were further reviewed and verified by the
responsive NDC Working Committee, established by the Ministry of
manner; Forests and Environment and comprising
representatives from government agencies and relevant
experts. Furthermore, the NDC was discussed at the
Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee on Climate
Change (IMCCCC) and shared with respective line
ministries and civil society organizations for formal input.
Finally, it was submitted to the Cabinet for approval.
ii. Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate:
Nepal is a landlocked country that lies in the southern
face of the Himalayan mountain range. The country is
located between 260 22' and 300 27' North latitude and
800 04' and 880 12' East longitude and covers an area of

development and Nepal’s climate is influenced by the Himalayan mountain
poverty eradication; range and the South Asian Monsoon. The climate has
four distinct seasons: pre-monsoon (March-May),
monsoon (June-September), post-monsoon (October-
November) and winter (December-February).
10Nepal is a Least Developed Country (LDC) whose
economy mostly depends on agriculture and
remittances. Nepal’s per capita GDP was USD 1,085 in
the fiscal year 2019/2020 with a growth rate of 7.5%
from the last fiscal year. However, the impact of COVID-
19 is already bringing these numbers down.
In the past two decades, the proportion of Nepali
people living in absolute material poverty has more
than halved from 49% in 1992 to 23% in 2015. Rates of
child and maternal mortality reduced significantly as well.
Primary school enrolment now exceeds 96% and has
gender parity. Average life expectancy at birth has
crossed 70 years. Nepal’s pace of development has
been one of the highest in the world. The latest Multi-
dimensional Poverty Index (MPI) shows that 28.6% of
the population is still low. This means their lives are
impacted by several deprivations simultaneously.
However, It also reveals that Nepal halved its official MPI
between 2006 and 2014.
Building on the relative success of the Millennium
Development Goals, Nepal is committed to pursuing and
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
by 2030, including the target set by the Sendai
Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction. These global
ambitions are broadly aligned with the social, economic,
environmental and risk reduction aspirations that Nepal
has set for itself in its new constitution.

4. Adaptation Component of NDC
As per Article 7.10 and 7.11 of the Paris Agreement, Nepal will submit an adaptation
communication, which will include its priorities, implementation and support needs,
16plans and actions through the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The NAP will outline
Nepal's contribution towards meeting the adaptation goals set out in the Paris
Agreement and the required means of implementation to implement that contribution
fully.
Nepal is at high-risk to the effects of climate change. Thus, adaptation will be a constant
requirement for the country. Adaptation priorities and actions, as per the National
Climate Change Policy (2019), adopt an integrated approach to cover climate-sensitive
sectors exemplifying the inter-sectoral nature of the responses. The adaptation priorities
cover eight thematic and four cross-cutting areas.
The thematic areas are:
 Agriculture and Food Security;
 Forests, Biodiversity and Watershed Conservation;
 Water Resources and Energy;
 Rural and Urban Settlements;
 Industry, Transport and Physical Infrastructure;
 Tourism, Natural and Cultural Heritage;
 Health, Drinking Water and Sanitation;
 Disaster Risk Reduction and Management.
The cross-cutting areas are:
 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI), Livelihoods and Governance;
 Awareness Raising and Capacity Building;
 Research, Technology Development and Extension;
 Climate Finance Management.
Nepal will accelerate adaptation by implementing the National Environment Policy
(2019), National Climate Change Policy (2019), Environment Protection Act (2019),
Environment Protection Regulation (2020), National Adaptation Program of Action
(NAPA) (2010), Framework on Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPA) (2019),
Disaster Risk Reduction National Strategic Plan of Action 2018 – 2030, Fifteenth Plan
17(2019/2020-2023/2024), and other national strategies and action plans. The key policy
priorities of Nepal, on adaptation, include the following:
 By 2030, all 753 local governments will prepare and implement climate-resilient
and gender-responsive adaptation plans. The plans will address climate change
and disaster vulnerability and risks and prioritize adaptation and disaster risk
reduction and management measures focusing on women, differently-abled,
children, senior citizens, youth, Indigenous Peoples, economically deprived
communities and people residing in climate-vulnerable geographical areas.
 The National Adaptation Plan (NAP) will be updated every ten years. Likewise, a
National level Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (VRA) will be carried out every
five years to inform climate resource allocation policies.
 By 2025, institutional mechanisms will be established and/or operationalized
including Environment Protection and Climate Change Management National
Council, Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Coordination Committee (IMCCCC),
thematic and cross-cutting working groups (TWGs/CWGs), Climate Change
Research Centre, Provincial Climate Change Coordination Committee and local
level institutional structures.
 By 2021, GESI and Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, and Climate
Resilient Planning and Budgeting Guidelines will be formulated.
 By 2025, a strategy and action plan on gender-responsive climate-smart
technologies and practices will be prepared and implemented.
 By 2025, climate change-related education will be included in all secondary
schools and 2,000 climate change adaptation resource persons will be mobilized
locally.
 By 2025, climate-sensitive diseases surveillance systems will be strengthened
through the integration of climate and weather information into existing
surveillance systems.
 By 2030, the population with access to the basic water supply will increase from
88% to 99%; and population with improved water supply will increase from 20%
to 40%.
18 By 2025, climate risk assessment mechanisms will be integrated into WASH
program planning and implementation cycle.
 Public Weather Services (PWS), including the Agro-Meteorological Information
System, will be strengthened and established.
 By 2030, a multi-hazard monitoring and early warning system covering all the
provinces will be established.
 By 2025, a national strategy and action plan on Loss and Damage (L&D)
associated with climate change impacts will be devised.
 By 2022, a Climate Finance Strategy, and National Capacity on Climate Finance
Management will be formulated.
 Adaptation measures based on circular economy and sustainable resource use
will be developed and implemented.
Nepal is in the process of developing its National Adaptation Plan (NAP). Through this
process, Nepal intends to implement medium and long-term adaptation needs, including
urgent and immediate priorities. Key outputs of NAP include the following:
 The NAP will be formulated by 2021. It will incorporate adaptation and resilience
milestones to be achieved in the short-term (by 2025), medium-term (by 2030)
and long-term (by 2050).
 By 2025, a Climate Information System will be established and operationalized.
 By 2022, a NAP Monitoring, Reviewing and Reporting Framework will be
developed and operationalized.
5. Means of Implementation
The cost of achieving Nepal's NDC conditional mitigation targets is estimated to be USD
25 billion. The cost of achieving unconditional targets outlined in the NDC is estimated
to be USD 3.4 billion. This estimate only covers activity-based targets and does not
include the cost of policies, measures and actions. The cost of achieving the adaptation
component will be detailed in the upcoming National Adaptation Plan (NAP).
To achieve the conditional targets, Nepal anticipates financial, technological and
capacity-building support from global funds such as the Green Climate Fund, Global
19Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund and
bilateral/multilateral agencies and development partners. These funds will be utilized to
bolster limited national resources and technical capacities for scaling up climate action.
The activities will be implemented for 10 years (2021-2030) by integrating them under
the fiscal budget as various subsidy policies, projects or programs. As these targets are
well aligned with the country’s existing policies and plans, they will have high ownership
and will be implemented on time at the national and sub-national levels. The key
elements during implementation include:
● Governance: Enact key acts and regulations and strengthen institutional
capacity to facilitate NDC implementation.
● Finance: Develop NDC financing and investment framework along with a
strategy to streamline access to funds while bridging the gaps in the public and
private sectors.
● Economic Efficiency and Cost Effectiveness: Ensure maximization of
economic benefits and cost-effectiveness during the implementation of the NDC.
● Equity and Inclusiveness: Include the principles of equity, ensuring equal
access to women, children, youth, Indigenous Peoples and marginalized groups
during participation, decision-making and benefit-sharing from NDC
implementation.
● Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV): Promote data-driven tracking of
NDC targets along with a strengthening of data generation and validation
framework. Identify best practices while also incorporating lessons learnt.
Maintain transparency by widely disseminating the methodology and results of
the MRV.
Nepal will prepare a detailed NDC implementation framework/roadmap/plan to ensure
the targets will be achieved in a systematic matter. The key elements of this
framework/roadmap/plan include:
20● Capacity Building: Identify and meet capacity-building needs across
government bodies to enable implementation of relevant policies and improve
collaboration across key ministries.
● Knowledge Management: Establish processes to retain knowledge within
institutions, including through data management systems for transparency and
MRV purposes.
 Institutional mechanism: Implement the NDC through federal, provincial and
local governments, in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders including
youth, women and Indigenous People. Coordinate NDC implementation
through the Environment Protection and Climate Change Management
National Council, Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Coordination Committee
(IMCCCC), Thematic and Cross-Cutting Working Groups, and Provincial
Climate Change Coordination Committees.
● Communication and Coordination: Develop clear lines of communication
between different levels of governance (local, provincial, national and
international) and across different sectors and stakeholders, including women,
Indigenous Peoples and youth.
● Finance: Develop a financing and investment framework that ensures efficient
access to climate funds and evidence-based allocations to areas of demand,
including the green recovery agenda. Ensure that the framework differentiates
between sources of finance to be used in each area, including in adaptation,
mitigation, and Loss and Damage.
● Tools: Develop tools and models to support inclusive decision-making during
planning and implementation of activities.

This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France 
47,5%, Croatia 16,7%, Italy 43,7%, Cyprus 32%, Latvia 17%,

 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

high rates of renewable electricity generation, and economic reliance on primary
industries are key factors that shape our national circumstances and are reflected in our
unique emissions profile, with emissions significantly coming from the agriculture sector.
The NDC reaffirms New Zealand’s commitment to the long-term temperature goal set out
in Article 2, paragraph 1(a) of the Paris Agreement, and to decisions of the Conference of
the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA), including
1/CMA.3, 1/CMA.4, and 1/CMA.5, which have since resolved to pursue efforts to limit the
global temperature increase to 1.5°C. New Zealand remains committed to playing its part
to achieve the long-term global temperature goal, including through this NDC.
New Zealand intends to separately report and communicate its climate finance as part
of its obligations under the Paris Agreement. This includes its biennial communications
under Article 9, Paragraph 5 of the Paris Agreement, and as part of its Biennial
Transparency Report. New Zealand’s Biennial Transparency Reports will serve
as its Adaptation Communications, unless otherwise specified.
Tokelau’s climate change contribution is included as part of the second NDC. New Zealand
extended its ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

multi-year target, as applicable
A single-year target was chosen to enhance understanding of our NDC, minimise complexity,
improve coherence between domestic and international climate architecture, and to better
incentivise and drive domestic action.
Our second NDC target is expressed as a range to enable New Zealand to respond to evolving
national circumstances, notably the high proportion of biogenic methane from agriculture in
New Zealand’s emissions profile. New Zealand is significantly investing in agricultural technology,
and this represents a promising area for emissions reductions. However, at the time of this
communication there is uncertainty about the impacts that emission reduction technologies,
including agricultural mitigation technologies, will have over the NDC period. The parameters
of the range reflect our highest possible ambition based on current expectations of commercial
feasibility of such technologies, while also allowing for flexibility to achieve greater emissions
reductions if these technologies become subject to widespread commercial application sooner
than expected.

obligations by enshrining in legislation the following:
responsive manner
1. A domestic emissions reduction target for 2050 requiring greenhouse gases, other than
biogenic methane, to reach net zero, and biogenic methane to reduce by 24–47 per cent
below 2017 levels by 2050.
2. A system of emissions budgets and emissions reduction plans to act as stepping stones toward
the 2050 target and to provide a framework for planning. Emissions budgets set a limit on the
amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed across a five-year period. Emissions reduction
plans set out the policies and strategies for achieving the respective emissions budget.
3. An adaptation policy cycle to assess and address the risks from a changing climate.
4. A Climate Change Commission to provide independent advice on mitigation and adaptation,
and to monitor progress on these.
The implementation of our first three emissions reduction plans will help put New Zealand on
a path to achieving our second NDC (New Zealand’s third emissions reduction plan, covering the
period 2031–35, is due by 2030). The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme remains a critical
policy tool in reducing our emissions to ensure our obligations under the Paris Agreement are met.
12 New Zealand’s second Nationally Determined Contribution – Tā Aotearoa Whai Wāhitanga Whakatau ā-Motu tuaruaSub-element Information
In 2029, we will publish our third emissions reduction plan for the period 2031–35 corresponding
to our NDC. This plan will outline sector policies for mitigation action over that time, moving us
towards achieving our NDC.
As technologies become available and national circumstances evolve, New Zealand will continue
to assess, realign and introduce policies to reduce emissions. For example, New Zealand is
currently investing substantially in agricultural technology and this represents a promising area
for emissions reductions.
Further information about New Zealand’s climate change policies and institutional arrangements
is available online, notably on the websites of the Ministry for the Environment, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Ministry for Primary Industries. Details will also be included
in New Zealand’s Biennial Transparency Reports.
Process to prepare NDC
In preparing our second NDC, New Zealand took into account factors such as:
• our commitment to supporting the achievement of the Paris Agreement temperature goal,
and subsequent CMA decisions that resolved to focus efforts on 1.5°C
• the feasibility of emissions reductions and removals in New Zealand over the NDC period
• the desirability of alignment with New Zealand’s domestic climate change settings,
including our emissions budgets, long-term emissions transition and domestic 2050
emissions reduction target
• the manageability of fiscal and economic costs.
We considered these factors within the broader context of the Paris Agreement, including
the outcome from the first Global Stocktake in 2023.
13 New Zealand’s second Nationally Determined Contribution – Tā Aotearoa Whai Wāhitanga Whakatau ā-Motu tuaruaSub-element Information
Our second NDC was informed by the following:
• The outcome of the first Global Stocktake. See Element 4c.
• Assessments of alignment with limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C. See Element 7b.
• Our wider policy response to climate change. The NDC was set to maintain coherence with our
second emissions reduction plan for 2026–30, and our third emissions budget over 2031–35.
The actions we implement as part of the second emissions reduction plan will contribute to
the quantum of emissions reductions we are able to achieve by 2035. The lower end of the
NDC target range aligns with our third emissions budget, which supports the delivery of both
our domestic emissions budget and our second NDC. The upper end of the NDC target range
requires greater emissions reductions than our third emissions budget. This will help drive
additional abatement over 2031–35, supporting the deliverability of both our third emissions
budget and second NDC, while maximising our ambition.
• Targeted engagement and public input carried out by the New Zealand Government between
October and December in 2024. Most stakeholders expressed their support for an NDC2 target
level that is ambitious yet achievable largely through domestic action, while remaining open
to using offshore mitigation. Stakeholders highlighted the importance of climate policy to be
in alignment with the level of ambition set in NDC2 for the target to be achievable. The key
themes from feedback received from stakeholders across economic sectors, ENGOs and the
general public included:
◦ the need for alignment and consistency between domestic and international climate targets
and policy
◦ ensuring limited NDC impact on trade and international reputation
◦ maintaining a balance between ambition and having an achievable and feasible target
with a clear action plan
◦ a preference for domestic action, while remaining open to the option for
international cooperation
◦ consideration to reduce economic impacts and costs to businesses and households.

Information on feedback from iwi and Māori is included in the following section. The feedback
received has been considered in the design of our second NDC.
• Analysis from New Zealand’s Climate Change Commission (Commission), as requested by the
Minister of Climate Change.2 The report considered what level of domestic emissions reductions
New Zealand could achieve toward our 2031–35 NDC, including the impacts associated with
those emissions outcomes. The Commission found that New Zealand could achieve greater net
emissions reductions by the end of the 2031–35 NDC period than in the 2021–30 NDC period
through domestic action alone. The Commission’s report is available online.
• Assessments of costs. Modelling covered the costs of delivering the NDC, and considered the
impacts on households, sectors and regions. We are cognisant that within these groupings,
children, Māori and Pasifika are especially vulnerable. In deciding our 2031–35 emissions
reduction plan corresponding to the NDC period, we will have an opportunity to look deeper
into the impacts of policies to achieve the necessary abatement. Our Climate Change Response
Act requires that our emissions reductions plans include a strategy to mitigate the impacts from
low-emissions transitions.
Engagement with indigenous peoples
New Zealand is founded on a partnership between the Crown and indigenous New Zealanders,
Māori, through Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi).
Climate change impacts Māori disproportionately. The Māori economy relies heavily on
climate-sensitive industries, such as forestry, agriculture, fisheries and tourism.
In determining the second NDC, the New Zealand Government considered how the NDC
may impact Māori rights and interests.
2 New Zealand’s Climate Change Response Act allows for the Minister of Climate Change to, at any time, request that the Climate Change Commission prepare reports to the Government on matters related to reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases and adapting to the effects of climate change.
15 New Zealand’s second Nationally Determined Contribution – Tā Aotearoa Whai Wāhitanga Whakatau ā-Motu tuaruaSub-element Information
The New Zealand Government consulted Māori on the second NDC (October-December 2024),
including with Pou Take Āhuarangi, the climate-focused branch of the National Iwi Chairs Forum
(NICF), which comprises 77 iwi across Aotearoa, and Post-Settlement Governance Entities (PSGEs).
PSGEs were invited to engage with the Ministry for the Environment on New Zealand’s 2031–35
NDC. Additionally, Māori representative bodies with climate change interests, or those that had
provided feedback on the second emissions reduction plan and/or New Zealand’s first NDC for
2021–30, were invited to engage.
The New Zealand Government will continue to engage with Māori on climate change policy
development. This includes devising the third emissions reduction plan for 2031-35 covering
the same period as the NDC. This is a requirement of our Climate Change Response Act, where
emissions reduction plans must include a strategy to recognise and mitigate the impacts on iwi
and Māori of reducing emissions.
(ii) Contextual matters, including, New Zealand’s national circumstances present challenges to, and opportunities for, reducing
inter alia, as appropriate: emissions. The country has a small population (5.3 million in 2024), which is widely dispersed
across a long, narrow and mountainous country. The country is located in the southwest Pacific

development and
poverty eradication New Zealand’s geography and population distribution have contributed to a dependence on fossil
fuel-powered transport. Because of this, and because of New Zealand’s primary sector exports
base, gross emissions are dominated by the agriculture and energy sectors (collectively these
sectors made up approximately 90 per cent of gross emissions in 2022). Although our energy
system is largely decarbonised, transport is the largest contributor to energy emissions.
Since 1990, New Zealand has experienced high population growth. New Zealand’s economy
has been growing faster than its emissions, showing signs that economic growth is decoupling
from emissions.
16 New Zealand’s second Nationally Determined Contribution – Tā Aotearoa Whai Wāhitanga Whakatau ā-Motu tuaruaSub-element Information
New Zealand’s agricultural system is largely pastoral. It is fundamental to the economy (with the
agricultural sector – excluding forestry, seafood and processed foods – contributing 64 per cent
of New Zealand’s merchandise exports in the year ended March 2024), exporting products to
countries all over the world.
Our agriculture sector contributes to New Zealand’s unique emission profile, contributing
to over half of our gross emissions at the time of this communication. In 2022, 49 per cent of
New Zealand’s gross emissions were from biogenic methane, and 9 per cent from nitrous oxide,
predominantly from our agriculture sector. There are currently few commercially available
solutions to mitigate biogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions, which makes achieving
deep emissions cuts from these sources of emissions difficult for New Zealand.
New Zealand farmers have made significant improvements in production efficiency across the
agriculture sector. This means that while overall production has increased, emissions per unit
of production have significantly decreased. As a result, gross emissions from agriculture have
remained relatively stable since 2006.
The New Zealand Government is investing significantly to accelerate the development and
commercialisation of tools and technologies to reduce emissions from the agriculture sector.
This will get technologies to market faster, enabling earlier uptake and impact. We expect to see
the uptake of mitigation solutions increase over time, which will support meeting our climate
change targets, as well as further improving the carbon footprint of our agricultural products.
New Zealand’s farming and growing systems are diverse, and not all mitigation tools will work
for all. This is why the Government is focused on delivering a range of adoptable solutions
suitable across different farm system types. We expect that these tools will be able to be used
internationally – bringing wider benefit to global emissions reduction efforts. Through our
international partnerships, such as the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse
Gases, New Zealand will also continue to collaborate globally to address agricultural greenhouse
gases while maintaining food production.
17 New Zealand’s second Nationally Determined Contribution – Tā Aotearoa Whai Wāhitanga Whakatau ā-Motu tuaruaSub-element Information
New Zealand has abundant renewable energy resources and a long history of renewable energy
development. In 2023, 88.1 per cent of electricity generation came from renewable sources –
primarily hydro, geothermal, and wind – contributing to relatively low energy sector emissions.
This is better than the OECD average, which is about 30 per cent. Continued development of
geothermal and wind renewables has seen the amount of electricity generated from these sources
more than triple since 1990. We continue to look to make further gains in this area. However, the
high levels of existing renewable electricity generation means New Zealand has limited emissions
reductions potential in the sector. Our greatest opportunity is therefore electrifying other sectors
of the economy, and exploring technological solutions for areas with higher abatement costs.
New Zealand has a significant forest estate and industry. We had 10.0 million hectares of forest
in 2022, covering approximately 37 per cent of our land. Of this, 7.8 million hectares were natural
(indigenous) forests, and 2.2 million hectares were planted. These forests contribute significantly
to removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Considerable investment in forestry in recent
years will further help us meet our emissions reductions goals. Appropriate incentives will be
required to balance encouraging afforestation for increased sequestration with other land uses.
Tokelau has been a dependent territory of New Zealand since 1926 and is considered ‘part
of New Zealand’ for certain purposes under the Tokelau Act 1948 (NZ). The extension of
New Zealand’s ratification of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement to Tokelau was announced
on 13 November 2017. Tokelau is included in New Zealand’s NDCs.
Tokelau’s low-lying atolls are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and related
hazards. The Government of Tokelau was engaged with to understand Tokelau’s interests and
views in the development of the NDC. Tokelau’s submission on the second NDC highlights its
vulnerability to climate impacts, and consequences for the people living on the three atolls.
“As an island nation at the forefront of climate change, the priorities for Tokelau are survival
– to live and thrive with change”. Tokelau is committed to tackling climate change.

Article 4, paragraph 9, of the
Paris Agreement The Global Stocktake recognised the need for urgent climate change action and support to keep
1.5°C within reach.
Our second NDC will make a credible contribution toward 1.5°C, as the range is greater than our
assessment of the global average rate of emissions reduction required to keep global warming
within 1.5°C – when considering New Zealand’s unique emissions profile, and disaggregation of
emissions reductions pathways by gas. The NDC aligns with our third domestic emissions budget,
as well as allowing us to achieve greater net emissions reductions below the domestic budget
limit. This puts us on track to reduce emissions at a pace fast enough to achieve our domestic net
zero target for all greenhouse gases (excluding biogenic methane) by 2050. In doing so, our second
NDC thereby contributes toward reducing total global emissions by the levels deemed necessary
to stay within 1.5°C as outlined in the 2023 Global Stocktake. Details on the alignment of our
second NDC with 1.5°C is provided under Element 7b.
The Global Stocktake further called on Parties to contribute to specific efforts not specifically
related to NDCs, such as on energy emissions, methane emissions, and forests and ecosystem
restoration. New Zealand is also taking considerable and concerted action in these areas, as
outlined in our domestic emissions reductions plans and Biennial Transparency Reports, available
on the Ministry for the Environment website.

ambitious in the light of its
Our national circumstances make abatement both challenging and costly. As outlined in
national circumstances
Element 4a(ii)(a), our national circumstances include, among others, high agricultural emissions,
a growing population and already achieving high levels of renewable electricity generation.
As a small, export-exposed economy, these factors mean our gross emissions reductions
comparatively carry considerable social, cultural, and economic costs. New Zealand also
has substantial rates of carbon sequestration from forestry.
New Zealand contributed approximately 0.14 per cent of global gross emissions in 2022. While
our total contribution to global emissions is relatively small, our per capita gross emissions for
all greenhouse gases are significantly higher than the developed-country average. This is due to
our high levels of biogenic methane emissions, which have a strong, but short-lived, atmospheric
effect. When looking at net carbon dioxide emissions only, our per capita emissions are relatively
low compared to similar developed countries, owing to substantial carbon sequestration from
forestry. Given our national circumstances, and based on the most recent IPCC report findings,
reducing long-lived greenhouse gases and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is our
focus, alongside deep reductions in other greenhouse gases.
New Zealand’s Commission takes into account our national circumstances in considering
our domestic climate change settings. In advising on our domestic emissions budgets,
the Commission assessed the emissions reductions New Zealand could achieve domestically
without creating undue risks and impacts on vulnerable parts of our population.
29 New Zealand’s second Nationally Determined Contribution – Tā Aotearoa Whai Wāhitanga Whakatau ā-Motu tuaruaSub-element Information
The lower end of our NDC range aligns with our third emissions budget, which reflects these
considerations. However, the upper end of the range goes beyond our third domestic emissions
budget to achieve greater emissions reductions but still remains feasible and within touching
distance to reflect these considerations, and ongoing investment in technologies to reduce
emissions.
6.b. Fairness considerations, In considering fairness, New Zealand looked at factors such as: national circumstances; cost of

Key messages
Niue’s future is imperilled by the effects of climate change for which it bears absolutely no responsibility.
Niue faces severe events and slow onset events from changes to the climate system caused by others.
Niue believes that loss and damage must be addressed in a sustainable and consistent manner to highlight
its significance and relevance in climate change, especially in developing countries. It is beyond Niue’s
national measures to address loss and damage alone from climate change. Building on the Alliance of Small
Island States (AOSIS) position, Niue is calling for loss and damage to be included as a separate element of
the 2015 Paris Agreement, an element that should be distinct from adaptation.
Against a high climate risk backdrop, the objective of Niue’s National Strategic Plan is to build a sustainable
future that meets our economic and social needs while preserving environmental integrity, social stability,
and the Niue culture. Much of the time and capacity of our small public service is put to devise and
implement plans to build climate resilience and enhance our disaster preparedness. Donor support is
critical to these efforts.
While Niue’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is negligible (less than 0.0001%), and Niue is
a net sink given the growth of our forests, nevertheless we are taking steps to reduce our emissions, in
particular in the energy sector. The Niue Strategic Energy Road Map (NiSERM) 2015-2025 outlines Niue’s
aspiration to meet 80% of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2025, which would in
turn reduce the country’s high reliance on imported fossil fuel. Part of this goal can be achieved through
national resources and identified assistance, but achieving such high levels of electricity from renewables
(from around 2% today) is very ambitious and will need considerable contributions of financial and capacity
support from our partners.
Section 1: Introduction
Niue has the distinction of being among the world’s least populated nation states and with a future that is
imperilled by the effects of climate change for which it bears absolutely no responsibility. In January 2004
the capital of Niue was destroyed by the category 5 Cyclone Heta. Niue knows the effects of severe events.
It is also seeing the impacts of slow onset events as its underground freshwater lens faces contamination
from rising sea levels.
Niue is a small Pacific Island Country (PIC) located partway between Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands.
The island is approximately 259 km² with an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 300,000km² and is reputedly
one of the world’s largest elevated coral atolls. The average height above sea-level is 23 metres and highest
point less than 70m.
Niue is vulnerable to climate risks such as tropical cyclones (TCs) and droughts; geological risks such as
earthquakes and tsunami; and human-caused risks such as disease outbreaks and contamination of its only
fresh water supply. Niue’s risk profile is also inherently linked to its isolation and limited capacity to manage
and respond to disasters and climate change impacts. Traditional coping strategies have tended to makeway for an increased reliance on external support, as New Zealand fulfils its obligations to provide support
to Niue in times of disaster.
Niue has no surface water and relies upon groundwater resources and rain catchments. Groundwater is
recharged via rainfall infiltration and rainfall currently exceeds the rate of extraction. However, Niue’s
porous soil renders its underground fresh water vulnerable to contamination, from both human causes
(e.g. agricultural chemicals) and natural sources (e.g. sea water). Agriculture is predominantly focused on
subsistence production, principally of root crops. The combination of relatively poor soils and dependence
on rainfall makes agricultural production highly sensitive to changes in rainfall frequency and amount.
Niue has a population of approximately 1500 (2013 census) spread across 14 villages. Large scale outward
migration, usually from younger age groups, has occurred since 1971, predominantly to New Zealand for
education, employment opportunities and family ties, as well as perceived higher standards of living
abroad. As a result, there are over 20,000 people identifying themselves as Niuean that live in New Zealand.
Niue’s economy is heavily dependent on support from New Zealand, which has a statutory obligation to
provide economic and administrative assistance to Niue. Aid accounts for 70% of Niue’s GDP, which is
NZ$10,000 per capita. Other sources of financial resources include taxation, government trading activities,
sovereign assets and additional support from development partners. Low population, scarcity of natural
resources, isolation and high costs of transportation lead to Niue’s economy being far from self-sufficient.
Climate change will exacerbate the already vulnerable situation in Niue outlined above. The most recent
report from the Pacific-Australia Climate Change Science and Adaptation Planning Program (PACCSAP)
provides the following future projections to 2100 for Niue:
 El Niño and La Niña events will continue to occur in the future (very high confidence), but there is
little consensus on whether these events will change in intensity or frequency;
 Annual mean temperatures and extremely high daily temperatures will continue to rise (very high
confidence);
 Mean annual rainfall could increase or decrease with the model average indicating little change
(low confidence in this model average), with more extreme rain events (high confidence);
 The proportion of time in drought is projected to increase or decrease in line with average rainfall
(low confidence);
 Ocean acidification is expected to continue (very high confidence);
 The risk of coral bleaching will increase in the future (very high confidence);
 Sea level will continue to rise (very high confidence); and
 Wave heights may decrease in December–March (low confidence), with no significant changes
projected in June–September waves (low confidence).
In particular, climate change impacts are likely to further exasperate both freshwater lens and coastal
water quality issues for Niue. For these reasons, protecting and enhancing natural resources, adequate
sanitation and wastewater treatment are among the government’s main priorities.
The risks climate change poses to Niue are therefore highly significant, and the ability of Niue to effectively
respond to minimise or avoid these risks is minimal. Niue therefore must rely on the international
community to avoid the dangers of climate change. This requires significant reductions in global
greenhouse gas emissions so that climate is stabilised to allow Niue’s natural and social systems to adapt,
and partnerships are developed between Niue and more developed nations to implement effective and
efficient adaptation responses.Section 2: National Response
The draft Niue National Strategic Plan (2014-2019) has a vision of Niue ke Monuina – A Prosperous Niue.
The objective is to build a sustainable future that meets our economic and social needs while preserving
environmental integrity, social stability, and the Niue culture.
The achievement of Niue ke Monuina is supported by seven national development pillars and specific
strategies under each of those pillars. Progress of the journey to prosperity is measured by targets and
indicators corresponding to each of the pillars.
1. Financial Stability – Ensure that sufficient financial resources are secured, and responsible fiscal
management is prudent, sustainable and supports healthy development strategies;
2. Governance – Ensure that good governance reflects the principles of transparency and
accountability and is practised at all levels;
3. Economic Development and Maintain Crucial Infrastructure – support families, public services,
and the private sector through tourism development with a safe, reliable, affordable healthy
infrastructure;
4. Social – Enjoy a harmonious and healthy lifestyle in a thriving, educated and safe community that
has access to a wide range of quality social services and healthy development opportunities;
5. Environment – Sustainable use and management of Niue’s natural resources and environment for
present and future generations;
6. Tāoga Niue – Promote, preserve and strengthen Niuean cultural heritage, language, values and
identity;
7. Private Sector Development – Be a prosperous and skilled island nation underpinned by a thriving
and entrepreneurial private sector.
While building resilience to climate change is not explicitly mentioned it is an integral part of Pillar 5, and
is of fundamental importance to all seven national development pillars.
Section 3: Approach to Building Resilience to Climate Change
Within the context of the draft NNSP 2014-2019 the key guiding documents for building resilience to
climate change in Niue are the National Climate Change Policy (2009) and Niue’s Joint National Action Plan
(JNAP) for Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation (2012).
The Vision of the National Climate Change Policy is for a “Safer, More Resilient Niue to Impacts of Climate
Change and Towards Achieving Sustainable Livelihood”. The Policy Goal is “To promote understanding of
and formulate appropriate responses to the causes and effects of climate change in support of national
sustainable development objectives.”
To attain this Policy Goal the following objectives have been identified along with associated Strategies:
1. Awareness Raising – To promote public awareness and improve stakeholder understanding of the
causes and effects of climate change and climate variability and as well as on vulnerability,
adaptation and mitigation responses;
2. Data Collection, Storage, Sharing, and Application – To improve and strengthen the collection,
storage, management and application of climate data, including greenhouse gases and emissions,
to monitor climate change patterns and its effects;
3. Adaptation – To develop effective adaptation responses and enhance adaptive capacity in order
to protect livelihoods, natural resources and assets, and vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate
change to all sectors;
4. Mitigation – To mitigate the causes of climate change and implement effective mitigation
measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;5. Governance and Mainstreaming – To mainstream climate change issues into national
development; and ii) establish an effective regulatory and institutional framework to facilitate the
development and implementation of national responses to climate change;
6. Regional and International Cooperation – To ensure Niue obtains maximum benefits from relevant
international and regional instruments relating to climate change and that it meets its
commitments under them.
In its commitment to building resilience, Niue has developed the Niue Joint National Action Plan (JNAP).
The JNAP strongly recognises the links between disaster risk management and climate change action, and
thus aims to operationalise the Climate Change Policy and vulnerabilities identified in the draft Second
National Communication (SNC). The JNAP also fulfils meeting the task of operationalising the Coastal
Development Policy.
The JNAP has the following goals:
Goal 1 – Strong and effective institutional basis for disaster risk reduction / climate change adaptation;
Goal 2 – Strong public awareness and improved understanding of the causes and effects of climate change,
climate variability and disasters;
Goal 3 – Strengthened livelihoods, community resilience, natural resources and assets;
Goal 4 – Strengthened capacity to adapt renewable energy technologies, improve energy efficiency and
energy security;
Goal 5 – Strengthened disaster preparedness for effective response.
Achievement of these Goals is through specific objectives and actions associated with these, which are fully
costed for donor support.
Revision of the Climate Change Policy and JNAP will likely be required both before and post 2020 with
costing of further identified activities for donor funding towards building a resilient Niue.
Section 4: Sector Policies and Plans
In addition to the NNSP and the Climate Change Policy there have been a number of recent policies which
have integrated climate change considerations into the decision making process. These include the Forest
Policy, the Niue National Energy Policy, and the Ecosystems Approach to Fisheries Management.
Furthermore, a number of Government departments have incorporated climate change policies into their
corporate plans, for example the Agriculture Sector Plan.
Other priority sectors for integration of climate change considerations into policies and plans include:
 Water Resource management
 Food security
 Climate Change Adaptation & Health Plan developed in 2013 by the Niue Health Department with
donor partners
 Waste & sanitation management strategy for general, liquid and organic wastes
 Building Code Review, update, including development of national standards
Donor funding will be required to support development of relevant sector policies and plans, all of which
will need to be developed, implemented & monitored to ensure full alignment with the goal of achieving
climate resilience. All sector plans will also need to incorporate measureable indicators to align with the
NNSP, and will need to be fully costed for donor funding.
By 2020, new sector plans will be required that are all fully costed for donor funding.Section 5: Mitigation context
Niue is one of the world’s least populated countries with low per capita emission of greenhouse gases. This
means that Niue’s contribution to this global problem is small, accounting for less than 0.0001% of global
greenhouse gas emissions. Removals from Niue’s forests outweigh its emissions many times over. As such,
Niue is a net carbon sink, removing in the order of 139Gg CO -e from the atmosphere each year.
2
However, Niue recognises there may be considerable scope through technological and behavioural means
to lower its emissions this further, congruent with Niue’s ambition to be a globally responsible citizen. It is
anticipated that mitigating greenhouse gas emissions can have substantial collateral benefits including:
decreased national expenditure associated with the escalating costs of importing fossil fuels; improved
energy security; improved local air quality; support for Niue as an eco-tourism destination and encouraging
sustainable development in the Pacific region.
Efforts to reduce GHG emissions are complementary to Niue’s focus on its vision to ‘build a sustainable
future that meets our economic and social needs while preserving environmental integrity, social stability,
and the Niue culture’.
The sectoral breakdown of Niue’s GHG emissions from the forthcoming Second National Communication
(2009 data, excluding waste) shows that the vast majority of Niue’s emissions come from the energy sector.
As shown in Figure 1 below, transport contributes the bulk of energy sector emissions at 57%, and
electricity generation the remainder, at 42%. The focus of GHG mitigation efforts for Niue is thus firmly on
transport and electricity generation.
Figure 1: Breakdown of Niue energy sector GHG emissions (2009, Second National Communication)
Residential

Transport 42%
57%
In 2015, Niue has a 100% electricity penetration rate and total electricity demand is fairly stable, having
recorded only 3% growth from 2008 to 2012. However Niue is 96% dependent on imported fuel for power
generation and 100% dependent on imported fuel for land, sea and air transportation.
Electricity generation
Reliable, affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply is key to achieving prosperity for all Niueans. In
light of Niue’s vulnerability on imported oil, the Niue Strategic Energy Road Map (NiSERM) 2015 – 2025
was developed, with the goal of “a sustainable energy sector for a Prosperous Niue”. The NiSERM builds
on the 2005 Niue Energy Policy (NEP) and the Niue National Strategic Plan (NNSP) 2014 – 2019, to pursue
five key motivations identified by stakeholders:
1. Reduced dependence on fossil fuels
2. Improved energy efficiency
3. More sustainable, cleaner energy
4. Improved cost-effectiveness of energy services
5. Attract funding for energy sector developmentNiue is committed to transitioning the electricity sector from fossil fuel to renewable energy. The NiSERM
outlines Niue’s aspiration to meet 80% of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2025,
which would in turn reduce the country’s high reliance on imported fossil fuel. This aspiration underpins
Niue’s contribution in this INDC, outlined in Section 6.
The period 2000-2009 saw progress on greenhouse gas emission mitigation in the form of the installation
of solar hot water heating, public education campaigns, increased grid penetration and distributed use of
renewable technologies, and the promotion of using low emission fuel sources and financial support for
the uptake of more efficient appliances.
However, Niue faces difficulties in mitigating climate change for two primary reasons. First, Niue lacks
environmental base data which would be able to support climate related decision-making. Second, Niue
lacks the capacity to monitor and evaluate energy supply initiatives. Without this support there is no way
to evaluate the cost or emission reduction effectiveness of programmes and take an adaptive management
approach.
Recent installations of solar PV, identified as the most feasible renewable energy source for Niue, have
seen grid stability issues arising that is inhibiting additional solar grid connections. The power sector in Niue
urgently requires technical assistance to address this issue.
There are further issues in establishing a renewable industry in Niue. These are the high degree of
subsidisation of electricity prices, a small market, high capital costs and lack of technological knowledge
within the utility.
Transport
The majority of fuel use is for land transport and the other major fuel user is the airline industry. As
international regulations limit scope for national interventions, Niue is focusing mitigation efforts on land
transport.
There is no public transport system in Niue and therefore private vehicles are the primary mode of
transport. There is currently no regulation that restricts the type of vehicles allowed into the country,
however in 2011 Customs regulations were amended to encourage the import of fuel-efficient vehicles
into Niue, and targets have been set under the NiSERM to deploy more fuel efficient vehicles.
Efforts are hampered by the limited availability of technological solutions for the transport sector.
However, this may be changing with the emergence of electrical vehicles, that could serve to be a resource
for electricity grid stability and a means of reducing oil dependence, providing solar charging as part of the
path to a 100% renewable electricity grid. The Government welcomes international assistance in the
development of opportunities for deep emissions cuts in the transport sector.
Land Use Change and Forestry
As mentioned, Niue is a net sink of greenhouse gases. It is important that the capacity of removals of
greenhouse gases by AFOLU be maintained, if not enhanced. Currently, forestry activity is low and
population decline has resulted in significant conversion of cropland to secondary rainforest. Removals
can be assumed to be highly sensitive to future population increases, residential infrastructure
replacement after cyclones or commercial forestry resumption. The Government of Niue is concluding a
National Forest Policy to provide strategic direction for the island’s forest areas.Section 6: Mitigation contribution
COUNTRY: Niue DATE: November 2015
Parameter Information
Period for defining 2020, 2025
contribution (outcomes)
Type and level of In line with Niue’s resilience approach to reduce dependence on imported fossil
contribution fuels, Niue will achieve a 38% share of renewable energy of total electricity
generation by 2020. (In 2014 the renewable energy share was 2% and this
contribution assumes assistance to address critical grid stability issues). This will
in part be delivered by a 10% reduction in residential, commercial and
government electricity demand by 2020. This contribution will be maintained out
to 2025 and will be delivered using national resources and international
assistance being identified to achieve the goals of the NiSERM.
Conditional upon additional international assistance, Niue could increase its
contribution to an 80% share of renewable energy of total electricity generation,
or to even higher levels, by 2025. This would require additional support for
energy storage and renewable energy generation, and strengthened frameworks
for project delivery.
Specific actions to deliver the above contributions are outlined in Annex 1. While
required investment to achieve the contributions has not been fully quantified,
investments required are far smaller than those needed to deliver a resilient
future for Niue in the face of climate change.
Estimated quantified In 2009 electricity generation contributed 2.1 Gg CO e as an emissions source.

emissions impact
The NiSERM Business as Usual forecast predicts a 33% increase in diesel
consumption for electricity generation from 2009-2020 and 75% increase by
2025, assuming economic and population growth and no GHG abatement
measures.
A 38% renewable energy contribution in 2020 would equate to a reduction of
364,000 litres of diesel per annum, or approximately 1.2 Gg CO e per annum.

An 80% renewable energy contribution in 2020 would equate to a reduction of
977,000 litres of diesel per annum, or approximately 3.1 Gg CO e per annum.

While Niue’s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is negligible (less than 0.0001%), and Niue is
a net sink given the growth of our forests, nevertheless we are taking steps to reduce our emissions, in
particular in the energy sector. The Niue Strategic Energy Road Map (NiSERM) 2015-2025 outlines Niue’s
aspiration to meet 80% of its electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2025, which would in
turn reduce the country’s high reliance on imported fossil fuel. Part of this goal can be achieved through
national resources and identified assistance, but achieving such high levels of electricity from renewables
(from around 2% today) is very ambitious and will need considerable contributions of financial and capacity
support from our partners.
Section 8: General caveats statement
The preparing of this INDC came during Niue’s development of its Second National Communication. As
such, data on GHG emissions are provisional and therefore subject to revision. The Second National
Communication, once completed, will provide a more comprehensive presentation of Niue’s circumstance,
plans and needs.
While there is a relatively high confidence regarding data on fuel importation and consumption, data
collection on other emissions sources is not yet developed sufficiently to make higher tier inventories
possible.
To obtain a better picture of the AFOLU sector will require an accurate, quality controlled survey of land
use status using up-to-date satellite imagery and GIS mapping. Waste surveys currently lack the sample
size and coverage to be statistically meaningful.Annex 1
Specific strategies, policies, plans and actions, including timing and support needs
The table below provides a summary of current priority items that Niue wishes to highlight as needing support or that are significant initiatives that the government will
take from its own budget resources. Available information dictates that these relate narrowly to mitigation actions; however, the list will be expanded in future to include
a more holistic set of priorities compatible with Niue’s resilience building development strategy. The investments required to achieve Niue’s mitigation contribution, while
not fully quantified, are far smaller than those needed to deliver a resilient future for Niue in the face of climate change.

Introduction
Following the decision 1/CMA.3 Glasgow Climate Pact paragraph 29 Norway has revisited the 2030 target in its Nationally Determined Contribution. The
updated NDC is to reduce emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
Norway seeks to fulfil the enhanced ambition through the climate cooperation with the European Union.
Norway submitted its intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent compared to 1990 by 2030 on March
3rd 2015. This included accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, with reference to decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.
The INDC became Norway's nationally determined contribution (NDC) through Norway's ratification of the Paris agreement on June 20th 2016 and the entry
into force 4th November same year. Norway have agreed to cooperate with Iceland and the European Union to fulfil this emission reduction target.
February 7th 2020 Norway updated its nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions by at least 50 per cent and
towards 55 per cent compared to 1990 levels by 2030.
Norway’s climate target for 20301 and 2050 is established by law in the Norwegian Climate Change Act. The purpose of the act is to promote the
implementation of Norway's climate targets as part of Norway's process of transforming to a low-emission society by 2050. The climate target for 2030 and
implementation of policies and measures to reduce emissions are important steps on the way to become a low-emission society, for more information see
section 4.
Related to an earlier version of the NDC, Norway has already agreed to cooperate with Iceland and European Union to fulfil the target of at least 40 per cent
emission reductions by 2030 under the Paris Agreement. By this climate cooperation, the European Union, Iceland and Norway are committed to reduce
their overall greenhouse gas emissions, in view of holding the increase in the global average temperature well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels,
and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
1 The Climate Change Act establishes by law Norway’s previous NDC from 2020. The Government will make an proposal to Parliament in order to amend the Act to update
the target in line with this NDC.
1According to the extended climate cooperation2 agreed upon with European Union and Iceland, Norway will fulfil their targets of at least 40 per cent
greenhouse gas emission reductions for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 in accordance with the EU climate framework.3 Norway also seeks
to fulfil the updated NDC through the climate cooperation with the EU4. The climate cooperation with Iceland and the European Union on implementing the
respective updated NDC targets for 2030 will require further arrangements.
The updated NDC will be presented to Parliament for its consideration.
Further information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU) of Norway's NDC
Norway has used the guidance on information to provide clarity, transparency and understanding in Decision 4/CMA.1 for information provided in the
Annex to this submission, as applicable to its nationally determined contribution.
2 In Decision No 269/2019 of 25 October the European Union, Iceland and Norway formally agreed to extend the climate cooperation for the period 2021 – 2030 by amending Protocol 31 of
the EEA Agreement, https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/news/20191025.pdf
3 The climate cooperation includes the following EU climate frameworks:
(1) Effort Sharing Regulation included in Protocol 31 of the EEA Agreement for the period 2021 – 2030 (Regulation (EU) 2018/842 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30
May 2018 on binding annual greenhouse gas emission reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030 contributing to climate action to meet commitments under the Paris
Agreement and amending Regulation (EU) No 525/2013)
(2) Regulation on greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry included in Protocol 31 of the EEA Agreement for the period 2021 – 2030
(Regulation (EU) 2018/841 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change
and forestry).
(3) Emission Trading System incorporated in Annex XX of the EEA Agreement (Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing
a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC)
4 The EU is working on updating its climate framework, cf. the “Fit for 55 package” which was presented 14 July 2021. The Norwegian Government will await the conclusion of EU’s legislative
process before making a decision on Norway’s continued participation in EU’s climate framework. Consent from the Parliament is required. Until a new EU climate framework for achieving the
EU’s enhanced target has been adopted, Norway will follow the current EU climate legislation.

that the Party undertook to prepare its the second update to Norway’s first NDC.
nationally determined contribution and,
if available, on the Party’s In Norway’s first NDC submission the target was to reduce emissions of at least 40 per cent
implementation plans, including, as by 2030 compared to 1990. That target was approved by the Parliament in 2015. Further, the
appropriate: target was established by law in the Climate Change Act adopted by the Parliament in June
2017. In October 2019 the EU, Iceland and Norway formally agreed to cooperate to fulfil
their respective emission reduction targets of at least 40 per cent by 2030. The strategy for
implementation was approved by the Parliament 26th April 2018.
In February 2020 Norway updated its NDC, and enhanced its target to reduce emissions by
at least 50 towards 55 per cent by 2030. In June 2021 the Parliament adopted changes in the
Climate Change Act and established that updated target by law.
In October 2022 the new Norwegian Government presented its Climate Status and Plan.
The main policy instruments are taxation of greenhouse gas emissions, regulatory measures
including the emissions trading scheme, climate-related requirements in public procurement
6processes, information on climate-friendly options, financial support for the development of
new technologies, such as CCS, and initiatives to promote research and innovation.
More information on policies and measures in place are described in Norway's reporting
under the UNFCCC and will be updated in the reporting under the Paris Agreement.
(i) Domestic institutional arrangements, Institutional arrangements: the emission reduction target for 2030 was established through
public participation and engagement interministerial processes.
with local communities and indigenous
peoples, in a gender-responsive manner; Through the climate cooperation with the European Union and Iceland, Norway has specific
legislation for the period 2021-2030 covering all emissions and sectors:
1. The EU Emission Trading System (ETS) regulates emissions from industrial plants,
power plants, the petroleum industry and commercial aviation within the European
Economic Area. About half of Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions are covered by
the ETS. Norway has been a part of the ETS since 2008 on the same terms as EU
Member States.
2. The Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) regulates emissions from transport, agriculture,
buildings and waste management and emissions from industry and petroleum not
covered by the ETS. The Effort Sharing Regulation sets binding national targets.
These targets can be fulfilled through domestic emission reductions and/or by use of
flexible mechanisms within the EU framework.
3. The Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation regulates
emissions and removals for the land use, land use change and forestry sector. The
regulation sets a national commitments to ensure that emissions do not exceed
removals in this sector.
The Ministry of Climate and Environment has the overarching cross-sectoral responsibility
for coordination and implementation. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the tax
schemes and the other ministries are responsible for policies in their respective sectors.
7Further details on institutional arrangements are found in Norway's National
Communication to the UNFCCC and will be reported under the Enhanced Transparency
Framework of the Paris Agreement.
The Environmental Information Act, implementing the Aarhus Convention, establish public
participation in decision making processes relevant for the environment. The Public
Administration Act requires legal proposals to be subject for public hearings. Consequently,
the Climate Change Act was on a public hearing including all stakeholders.
For consultations with indigenous people, Sami People, procedures for consultation
processes between the central government and the Sámediggi, established in 2005,
constitute a crucial framework for ensuring Sami rights under international law to participate
in processes that may affect them.

priorities acknowledged when joining institutionalised tripartite dialogue between the government, trade unions and labour
the Paris Agreement organisations already in the 1960ties. This serves, amongst others, to stabilize the
economy and work life in periods of transition. It is a priority for the Government to
8facilitate the creation of profitable green jobs through pricing, public procurement,
regulations and measures that supports technology development.
Human Rights: Human rights are enshrined in the The Norwegian Constitution. The
Human Rights Act establishes the main conventions on human rights as Norwegian law.
This act prevail over other Norwegian legislation in case of conflicts between norms.

Food security: There is a scarcity of agricultural land in Norway especially suitable for
arable crops. Norway's role in global food security in the context of climate change is to
adapt to a changing climate, manage and use these resources sustainably, to secure food
supplies while emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced.
Gender equality: In 2018, a new and comprehensive Equality and Anti-Discrimination
Act entered into force. The Act's purpose is to promote gender equality. The Act
provides protection against discrimination on the basis of gender, pregnancy, leave in
connection with birth or adoption and care responsibilities. Women and men are to be
given equal opportunities in education and work, and in their cultural and professional
development.

(e) Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate,
including, as applicable:
(i) Approach to addressing emissions and Emissions and subsequent removals from natural disturbances on afforested land and
subsequent removals from natural managed forest land may be excluded from the accounting if the emissions from the natural
disturbances on managed lands; disturbance exceed the average emissions caused by natural disturbances in the period 2001-
2020, excluding outliers (background level), if calculated as in accordance with Art 10 and
Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841.
(ii) Approach used to account for emissions Norway uses the production approach to account for emissions and removals from harvested
and removals from harvested wood wood products, as defined in the IPCC Guidelines. This is in accordance with Art. 9 and
products; Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841.
(iii) Approach used to address the effects of Within the climate cooperation with the European Union and Iceland agreed in relation to
age-class structure in forests; the implementation of the 40 per cent targets (see para 4 a), emissions and removals in
managed forests in the period 2021 – 2030 will be accounted for as the deviation from a
projected forward-looking forest reference level, with regards to dynamic age-related forests
characteristics, as in accordance with Art. 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841.

Agreement, if applicable. The current EU climate framework referred to in 4 a (i) does not open for the use of
internationally transferred mitigation outcomes from outside the EU/EEA. Norway also
seeks to fulfil the updated NDC of least 55 per cent reductions through the climate
cooperation with the European Union. Final accounting towards the target may depend on
any further arrangements in Norway's cooperation with the European Union and Iceland,
including in the European Trading System.
If necessary, Norway will use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement
to fulfil the part that goes beyond what is achieved through the climate cooperation with the
European Union.
Norway will report on progress towards its nationally determined contribution through the
transparency framework under the Paris Agreement, and account for its cooperation with the
European Union in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by CMA and further
guidance agreed by the CMA.
6 How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national
circumstances:
(a) How the Party considers that its Norway's approach to consider fairness and ambition is to assess how its nationally
nationally determined contribution is determined contribution contributes to meeting the global long-term goal of the Paris
fair and ambitious in the light of its Agreement, with weight on pursuing efforts to limit the global warming to 1.5 degree
national circumstances; increase, taking into account fairness and equity. The most important basis for such an
assessment is the IPCC reports. For example, by taking into account the remaining global
carbon dioxide emission budget and the need for deep reductions in other greenhouse gases,
consistent with achieving the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. In considering
fairness and equity, Norway takes into account national circumstances, including the fact
that Norway is a high-income country that should undertake ambitious emission reduction
targets. These considerations lay the basis for Norway’s nationally determined contribution
to be in line with the principles of the Paris Agreement, the Norwegian Climate Change Act
and align with the global long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.
15A key finding in the IPCC report ,that has been considered, is that achieving the Paris
temperature goal requires rapid, deep and sustained emission reductions in all sectors. To
keep 1.5°C within reach, global emissions need to be reduced by about 43 percent by 2030
compared to 2019, and by about 27 percent by 2030 to limit global warming to 2°C degree
increase.
Norway's nationally determined contribution is to reduce emissions with at least 55 per cent
by 2030. Norway’s NDC reflects a path towards 2050 that goes beyond most average
reductions in the global emissions pathways towards 2050 needed to keep global warming in
line with the global long-term goal of the Paris Agreement. Norway consider its target to be
fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances.
Norway also provides significant support that contribute to emission reductions in
developing countries. These efforts also contribute to achieve the Paris temperature goal,
and Norway’s efforts are thus wider than what is covered by our NDC.

(c) How the Party has addressed Article 4, Norway's updated and strengthened nationally determined contribution represents a

It is an ambitious target for Norway to achieve by 2030. Norway has considered how to
increase ambition, and Norway believes the strongest way of doing this is to do on a
European basis, together with the European Union. The achievement of the target is
dependent on a broad set of mitigation measures. The implementation of the enhanced NDC
for 2030 will be an important part of Norway's process of transforming to a low-emission
society by 2050.

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution
November 2015
1. Introduction
The Republic of Palau is committed to the successful conclusion of negotiations under the Ad-­‐Hoc
Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) in order to adopt, at COP21, a new
legally-­‐binding agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) applicable to all Parties, to come into effect in 2020.
In accordance with decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, the Republic of Palau is pleased to communicate its
Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) towards achieving the objective of the UNFCCC, as
well as accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency, and understanding of its INDC.
The Republic of Palau is also pleased to provide additional accompanying information on our mitigation
effort and support for implementation.
2. Intended Nationally Determined Contribution – Mitigation [Contribution]
Timeframe Start year: 2020 End year:2025
Type of commitment Absolute energy sector emissions reduction target, with additional
reductions coming from the waste and transport sectors.
Reference/base year Reference/base year is 2005 – emissions were approximated at 88
thousand tCO2e
Estimated quantified emissions Indicative targets:
reductions ₋ 22% energy sector emissions reductions below 2005 levels by
2025
₋ 45% Renewable Energy target by 2025
₋ 35% Energy Efficiency target by 2025
Coverage Energy (electricity generation), transport and waste sectorsGases: Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and methane (CH4)
Baseline assumption Business as Usual (BAU) emissions scenario projections are based on
economic growth in the absence of new climate change policies and
measures in addition to those in place in 2015, and greater coverage
and implementation of existing measures.
BAU projections include the electricity sector only, which is Palau’s
largest emitting sector. BAU assumptions include a GDP per capita
growth of 3.72% per year (historical 15 year CAGR) and EIA oil price
projections in reference case as the basis for residential, government
and commercial sector energy use growth projections. Commercial
energy use growth projections also took into consideration energy
use by private generators in the tourism sector.
Emission from the waste management and transport sectors are not
included in the BAU projection however emission reduction
initiatives will be addressed on a project basis.
Intention to use market-­‐based No
mechanisms to meet target
Land sector accounting approach N/A
Planning Process Palau’s INDC is grounded in the Palau Climate Change Policy, which
was informed by input from communities, civil society and other
stakeholders, as well as on the preparatory work for Palau’s second
National Communication which was also widely consulted.
The Policy establishes Palau’s National Appropriate Mitigation
Actions (NAMA) and National Adaptation Plan (NAP) as well as the
institutional and policy frameworks for: (a) climate change
mitigation via management of greenhouse gas emissions including
carbon sinks; and (b) climate change adaptation and risk reduction
and management. It establishes the policy framework that will guide
and inform action in accordance with Palau’s National Master
Development Plan – Palau 2020.
Fair and Ambitious The Republic of Palau’s total emissions are de minimis in the global
context. Given Palau’s remoteness, the small size of the economy,
low GDP per capita, dependence on partnership support and
vulnerability to climate change, Palau’s proposed targets are
ambitious and fair as measured against other nations.
Under the BAU scenario emissions would be 140 thousand tCO2e in
2025, compared to 68 thousand tCO2e if both the renewable energy
and energy efficiency targets are met.Emissions in 2005 were approximated at 88 thousand tCO2e.
Full implementation of the renewable energy and energy efficiency
strategies outlined below puts Palau on a trajectory to reducing
emissions by half as against BAU in 2025, the equivalent of 22%
under 2005 emissions levels.

3. Accompanying Information on Palau’s INDC
a. General information on Palau
Palau is joining the community of nations, both industrialised and developing, in taking action to address
the causes and impacts of climate change. Palau is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climatechange, principally from sea level rise and the increase in extreme events (drought, flooding, Category 4
and 5 typhoons). Sea-level rise threatens vital infrastructure, settlements, and facilities that support the
livelihood of island communities. Moreover, under most climate change scenarios, water resources in
small islands are likely to be seriously compromised. Subsistence and commercial agriculture will be
adversely affected by climate change, and ocean warming and acidification will heavily impact coral
reefs, fisheries, and other marine-based resources crucial to our livelihoods, economy and culture.
b. Mitigation: Current and Future Policies and Measures to achieve INDC targets
i. Current Policies and Measures
Currently Palau is working to increase the share of renewables in our energy mix and to
increase energy efficiency initiatives. To date, total renewable energy efforts have only
reached 8% of the needed 22%, principally because two grid-­‐connected solar projects (1.5
and 3.5MW respectively) never came to fruition. However to date Palau has achieved an
approximately 30% reduction in energy use due to efficiency measures taken.
Current renewable energy and energy efficiency policies and measures include: a pilot loan
subsidy for solar roof panels which will be increased to cover more homes if successful; a
Home Energy Efficiency Program at the Palau National Development Bank; prepaid metering
at Palau Public Utilities Corporation; distribution of CFL light bulbs; government building
retrofits; and, a pilot Energy Audit program for large commercial buildings.
ii. Future Policies and Measures to achieve INDC targets
To achieve the renewable energy target Palau will need considerable additional installed
capacity, including the 5MW of solar already planned (two or more solar projects plus
additional roof-­‐top solar) plus an additional 10 MW to power the water sector. Palau will
also have to work to reduce transmission and distribution losses. (Solar Capacity Factor is
assumed to be 15.3%.)
To implement the Energy Efficiency target, Palau will:
₋ Increase the Energy Retrofit Program;
₋ Institute a Tropical EE Building Code;
₋ Adopt the Energy Star Appliance Standard;
₋ Implement an Energy Labeling Scheme;
₋ Significantly expand our Cool Roof Program;
₋ Expand Energy Audit program to include all government and non-­‐government
buildings;
₋ Enhance the Building Managers Working Group; and
₋ Improve Wastewater Infrastructure.Many of these renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives will depend on the
availability of partnership finance and technology support.
i. Additional project based initiatives in the transport and waste sectors
Reducing Methane Emissions from the Solid Waste Sector
₋ Palau has developed a “National Solid Waste Framework” but has not had funding
to implement the planned actions. A key next step is to analyze landfill gas
emissions and evaluate the potential for landfill gas capture projects at the national
landfill site.
Transport Sector
₋ Currently there is a pending national legislation that would mandate the use and
commercial sale of four stroke outboard motor engines only to reduce emissions.
₋ Palau is investigating a project to convert waste cooking oil to biofuel for diesel
vehicles, beginning with public school buses and a potential public bus route.
c. Support for Implementation
Climate change presents a major challenge for Palau’s sustainable development, for which
the nation relies significantly on development partnerships. Similarly, as noted above,
implementation of many of the policies and measures needed to achieve our emissions
reduction target will depend on the availability of partnership finance, technology support
and capacity development.
Based on a first-­‐order estimate, the upfront investment cost for the renewable energy and
energy efficiency measures in Palau’s INDC would be on the order of $5.5 million USD. This
investment has the potential to generate savings, on a net-­‐present-­‐value basis, of $2.5
million by 2025. This figure doesn’t show the full picture of potential returns on investment
though, as there was not sufficient data to assess the energy efficiency savings which have
the potential to be substantial.",0,0.03855140187,0.004672897196,0.001168224299,0.005841121495,0.002336448598,0,0,0,0.001169590643,0,0,0,0.005841121495,0.001168224299,0.002336448598,0,0,0,0,0.01051401869,0.001168224299,0.002336448598

Nationally Determined Contribution
Communicated to the UNFCCC on 15 April 2021
The Republic of the Philippines submits its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in
accordance with Decision 1/CP.21 of the Conference of Parties of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The Philippines’ NDC supports the country’s national development objectives and priorities of
sustainable industrial development, poverty eradication and inclusive growth, energy security,
and social and climate justice, and the transformation of its socio-economic sectors towards a
climate and disaster-resilient and low carbon economy.
The Philippines shares the view that the NDC is a means to communicate opportunities for
transforming our world with gender-responsive sustainable development options through the
commitment of Parties to support and complement each other’s endeavors in accordance with
the partnership arrangement under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.
Developed through a whole-of-government-and-society approach, the Philippines’ NDC
upholds the importance of meaningful participation of women, children, youth, persons with
diverse sexual orientation and gender identity, differently abled, indigenous peoples, elderly,
local communities, civil society, faith-based organizations, and the private sector, and
recognizes the indispensable value of inclusion and collaborative participation of local
governments in implementing climate actions. It shall enable a market signal to support local
and foreign direct green investments. The NDC recognizes the private sector as the country’s
main engine of economic growth and transformation, and promotes its full engagement in
climate change adaptation and mitigation.
1Aware of its exposure and vulnerability to climate change impacts and the increasing losses
and damages the Philippines is incurring, it is employing its full national political strength to
address the problem of climate change. Thus, the NDC is also based on and informed by
national laws, as well as domestic legal, financial, and policy frameworks, with the
accompanying instruments and institutional arrangements on adaptation and mitigation,
foremost of which is Republic Act No. 9729, otherwise known as the Climate Change Act of
2009, as amended by Republic Act No. 10174, and its requisite policy instruments, the
National Framework Strategy on Climate Change 2010-2022 and the National Climate
Change Action Plan 2011-2028. The NDC also considers the Philippine Development Plan
2017-2022, Philippine Energy Plan 2018-2040, the Philippine National Security Policy 2017-
2022, National Climate Risk Management Framework of 2019 and the Sustainable Finance
Policy Framework of 2020. It shall also be progressively informed by the Filipino people’s
aspirations across generations.
The Philippines, in line with its national security policy and its sustainable development
aspirations and in solidarity with ASEAN Member States, shall endeavor to peak its emissions
by 2030 in the context of accelerating the just transition of its sectors into a green economy
and the delivery of green jobs and other benefits of a climate and disaster-resilient and low
carbon development to its people, among others.
The NDC upholds the importance of ensuring ecosystems integrity and promoting the
country’s obligations on human rights and the rights of its indigenous peoples.
The Philippines recognizes the importance of traditional knowledge, education and public
awareness, and enhancement of climate actions through measures embodied in Article 12 of
the Paris Agreement, and shall endeavor to institute a multi-level mechanism in this regard in
the implementation of the NDC.
2National Circumstances
The Philippines is a low-middle income developing country with a current population of 108.7
million,1 growing at a projected average rate of 0.84 percent2 until 2040. Located in the
Tropical Cyclone belt and the Pacific Ring of Fire, it is extremely vulnerable to climate-related
and geological hazards that include around 20 tropical cyclones every year and an almost
daily occurrence of seismic shocks which cost the country an average of 0.5% of its GDP
annually.3 It is burdened with 16.7% poverty incidence4 and saddled with an aging
infrastructure and intermittent insecurities in the food and agriculture and health sectors.
Despite these, the Philippines remains steadfast in achieving zero poverty by 2040 and
sustainable and inclusive economic growth.5
Loss and damage from extreme weather events are increasing at an unacceptable rate,
reaching 4% of GDP in 2013 due to Super Typhoon Haiyan.6 The successive typhoons in
October and November 2020 alone resulted in approximately USD 852 million in losses and
damages in agriculture and infrastructure.7 In the energy sector, Super Typhoon Goni alone
destroyed USD 56.3 million worth of infrastructure in 25 provinces in the country.8 Noting the
increasing difficulty for fast and timely recovery, it is apparent that the loss and damage
impacts of these climate events are outstripping the country’s capacity to withstand climate
shocks.

3Climate Change Mitigation
In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the Philippines emits an average of 1.98 metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita in 2020, or way below the global average of four
(4) metric tons per capita.
The Philippines commits to a projected GHG emissions reduction and avoidance of 75%, of
which 2.71% is unconditional9 and 72.29% is conditional,10 representing the country’s
ambition for GHG mitigation for the period 2020 to 2030 for the sectors of agriculture, wastes,
industry, transport, and energy.11 This commitment is referenced against a projected
business-as-usual cumulative economy-wide emission of 3,340.3 MtCO e 12 for the same
2
period.
The country’s climate change mitigation actions shall strengthen the resilience and adaptive
capacity of the country, including through enhanced access to climate finance, technology
development and transfer, and capacity building, especially on the implementation of the
policies and measures on and the uptake of circular economy and sustainable consumption
and production practices.
The implementation of the mitigation commitments shall be undertaken through bilateral,
regional and multilateral cooperation. In addition, the benefits of market and non-market
mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement shall continue to be explored, consistent
with national circumstances and sustainable development aspirations.
9 Unconditional refers to policies and measures which can be undertaken using nationally mobilized resources.
10 Conditional refers to policies and measures which require support or the means of implementation under the Paris
Agreement.
11 Greenhouse gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
12 Million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
4Climate Change Adaptation
The National Climate Change Action Plan 2011 - 2028 established the seven thematic areas
of government action to address climate change, namely food security, water sufficiency,
ecological and environmental stability, human security, climate-smart industries and services,
sustainable energy, and knowledge and capacity development, which are pursued coherently
with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk
Reduction.
The Philippines shall undertake adaptation measures across but not limited to, the sectors
of agriculture, forestry, coastal and marine ecosystems and biodiversity, health, and human
security, to preempt, reduce and address residual loss and damage. The Philippines shall
pursue forest protection, forest restoration and reforestation, and access to results-based
finance in forest conservation. The country shall also endeavor to undertake equitable
adaptation strategies with mitigation co-benefits and ensure their contribution to the national
pandemic recovery. For this purpose, the Philippines shall diligently access the means of
implementation under the Paris Agreement.
Concluding Note
The Philippines’ NDC conveys the country’s progressive climate change mitigation
commitment and adaptation challenges and requirements, including addressing residual loss
and damage, in pursuit of low carbon, sustainable, and climate and disaster-resilient
development. With continuing analysis and public-private sector collaboration, enhancements
on this NDC are expected to reflect increasing ambition and economy-wide mitigation
potential, based on the growth directions and projected climate change adaptation needs of
the Filipino people. These shall include enhancement of transformative policies and measures
for climate change mitigation and information for clarity, transparency, and understanding in
accordance with relevant guidelines. The Philippines shall continue to engage all stakeholders
concerned in the NDC implementation, updating, and monitoring and review processes.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change.

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%,

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

1. Executive summary: 
The State of Qatar is pleased to communicate its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in accordance with decisions 
1/CP.19, 1/CP.20 & in line with decision 24/CP.18 and the provisions and principles of UNFCCC. 
The Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), communicated in 2015, was designed to 
reflect a balanced approach where adaptation, economic diversification, and mitigations were given 
equal treatment as suggested by Article 4.7 and Article 7 of the Paris Agreement (PA).  
This current communication reflects an enhanced ambition by the State of Qatar towards reducing its 
overall emissions in response to the guidance set forth in Article 4.4 of the Paris Agreement. Qatar 
intends to reduce 25% of its GHG emissions by the year 2030, relative to baseline scenario {Business-
As-Usual (BAU)}. 
For the past several decades, Qatar has maintained a pioneering role in the international efforts to tackle 
climate change & promote sustainable development through the export of natural gas and its 
derivatives to the world’s energy market. These fuels are cleaner & efficient energy sources compared 
to conventional fuels. They contribute to both, CO2 emission reduction & improvement of air quality 
conditions. 
In accordance with PA Article 4.8 and Decisions 1/CP.21, 4/CMA.1, Qatar stands firm in its 
commitment to the Paris Agreement and is determined to pursue its ambition and actions for climate 
adaptation and mitigation as per its national circumstances and capability. The pertinent information 
to that effect are listed as follows:

Emission reduction ambition. 
The reduction of 25% in GHG emissions for the year 
2030, relative to BAU scenario is consistent with 
provisions stipulated in Articles 4.3, 4.4 and 4.7 of PA. 
Also, Article 6 is considered in the implementation. 
5 
BAU and NDC target scenarios 
The BAU scenario starts in the year 2019 and considers 
mitigation measures implemented by the State of Qatar 
until the end of 2019. The NDC target scenario 
represents a deviation from the BAU, accounting for 
implemented and planned measures for the period 2020- 
2030.

Fairness and ambition of NDC 
based on national circumstances 
Qatar is a low GHG emitting country. Historically it has 
been actively participating in the global efforts to 
address climate change through provision of cleaner 
natural gas fuels to the global energy market, thereby 
reducing the international consumption of carbon 
intensive alternatives. The Qatari economy is highly 
dependent on natural gas export revenues. This makes 
Qatar vulnerable to the negative impacts of response 
measures as well as the impact of climate change and its 
adverse effects (Art. 4.8 of the Convention).  
8 
Contribution 
to 
the 
accomplishment of the objective 
of Article 2 of the convention.  
Through the mitigation measures by 2030 and 
considering 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
objectives, Qatar will contribute on an equitable basis to 
the achievement of the objective of Article 2 of the 
convention.  
2. National Circumstances  
Qatar is a developing country, a small peninsula in the Western part of the Arabian Gulf. Climatic 
conditions are extreme due to the prevailing desert environment with an average annual rainfall of 
less than 80 mm, with significant inter-annual variations. This results in a scarcity of drinkable water 
and local food supply. The state depends highly on the desalination of seawater as the main water 
source for urban needs in addition to a limited reserve of ground water that’s used for irrigation 
purposes. 
Although the essential living resources are rare, Qatar is blessed with vast natural gas resources that 
are being used to overcome the living difficulty on this land. Since the exploration of hydrocarbons 
in Qatar, the oil & natural gas sector, together with the petrochemical sector have been the key 
contributors to the economic and social growth of the state and welfare of the population. 
Qatar’s economic prosperity depends on the oil & gas sector since it contributes a large portion of the 
GDP. At the same time, the oil & gas sector is also the leading contributor to domestic GHG 
emissions. Consequently, balancing economic stability and environmental sustainability will be 
essential for long-term success in the mitigation of climate change. Transition to a more sustainable 
economy is essential without jeopardizing the economic prosperity of the nation. Given its geographic 
location, Qatar is likely to suffer from severe consequences of global warming. Under the major 
impact of climate change, Qatar is extremely vulnerable to rising sea level and air temperature 
increase, leading to inland flooding and heat exhaustion of its population, in addition to the potential 
risks to the marine biodiversity, food security, loss and damage due to climate change.  
Sea level rise receives most of the government attention because of the large coastal population at 
risk of inundation (particularly during extreme sea level events). Subsequently, climate change also 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
4 
poses a threat to the tourism industry of Qatar, largely due to the increase in temperature and 
frequency of dust storms. Qatar’s ecology, environmental resources, infrastructure and human 
systems are vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change, the latter includes coastal and 
offshore installations such as power and water cogeneration facilities, and the oil & gas infrastructure. 
Moreover, the State’s economy is also impacted by the response measures. In view of this, the 
international climate change measures and policies are guided by the provisions of the UNFCCC, 
particularly Article 3 paragraph 2 and Article 4 paragraph 8 (e & h) and Article 4 paragraph 10.3.  
3. Economic Diversification with Mitigation Co-benefits  
Historically, Qatar’s economy has been driven by the availability of hydrocarbon resources. However, 
to maintain development and sustainable growth, a national vision was adopted to diversify the 
economy and build a skilled society capable of sustaining its own development and ensuring a high 
living standard. Qatar’s National Vision 2030 (QNV 2030) and Qatar’s National Development 
Strategy (NDS-1 & NDS-2) lay a strong emphasis on economic diversification and sustainable 
development. 
Some of the key areas for diversification with mitigation co-benefits are stated below: 
a) Oil & Gas 
The oil & gas sector constitutes the backbone of Qatar’s economy. It encompasses the entire spectrum 
of the oil & gas value chain. This includes the exploration, production, processing, marketing and 
sales of oil & gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids (NGL), gas to liquids (GTL) 
products, refined products, petrochemicals, and fertilizers, steel and aluminum. The State has already 
initiated several measures to make its oil & gas sector more sustainable. The Al Shaheen flare 
reduction project (one of the world’s largest) and the Jetty boil-off gas recovery project have laid 
solid foundations towards emission reduction.  
The Al-Shaheen Oil Field Gas Recovery and Utilization Project has been registered as a Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM) project since 2007 for 21 years within the framework of the Kyoto 
Protocol. The project received approval from the UNFCCC for the seven-year crediting period from 
2014 to 2021, and it is expected to abate approximately 1.2 million tons of CO2 each year during this 
period. 
The national oil company, Qatar Petroleum (QP), is committed to zero routine flaring by 2030, with 
a long-term goal to reduce flaring in onshore facilities to the absolute minimum. Technically feasible 
non-routine flaring is also covered. Carbon capture storage (CCS) will be another pivotal measure for 
reducing the GHG emissions from the sector. Qatar commissioned the largest CO2 recovery and 
sequestration facility in the MENA region at Ras Laffan in 2019 with a design capacity of 2.2 MTPA 
of CO2 capture and storage. CCS is included for new LNG facilities and concepts, for remaining LNG 
facilities will be developed and implemented considering the economic, safety and environmental 
concerns. 
QP signed a set of Guiding Principles on 22 March 2018 that aim to reduce methane emissions across 
the natural gas value chain stretching from production to the final consumer. The principles aim to 
continuously curb methane emissions, stimulate strong performance across gas value chains, enhance 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
5 
the accuracy of methane emissions data, advance sound policies and regulations on methane 
emissions, and to increase transparency. In 2019, Qatar Petroleum introduced the smart leak detection 
and repair program (LDAR) in all upstream and downstream facilities of the oil & gas industry. Qatar 
further plans to move towards a fully integrated fugitive methane monitoring and repair program 
across all assets.  
Qatar is enhancing energy efficiency in the oil & gas sector as a key measure to reduce GHG 
emissions. The energy efficiency program includes several projects that are allocated in upstream 
facilities as well as gas-to-liquid and downstream facilities. Amongst the variety of measures in 
energy efficiency, certain initiatives are aimed to be implemented by 2025, e.g., seasonal optimization 
of gas turbine generators and boilers, improved measurement / balancing for fuel gas / steam, and 
improved reliability of heat recovery steam generator (HRSGs). Furthermore, through innovative 
technologies and processes such as energy efficiency performance monitoring, improved reliability 
of waste heat recovery systems and recycling of excess fuel gas/off gas are also addressed. Qatar also 
plans to efficiently utilize its power plant capacities by usage in other upstream facilities or feed-in 
from GTL (gas-to-liquid) facilities to its utility distribution / transmission grid. Electrical generation 
capacity shall be shared and optimized across all upstream facilities. This would allow more efficient 
dispatch of generating capacity and keep the units closer to their most efficient operating levels, 
thereby reducing gas consumption and GHG emissions. 
b) Power & Water 
Most of Qatar’s power production comes from natural gas resources. Urban water supply is mostly 
drawn from sea water desalination facilities, often using energy-intensive technologies i.e. Multi-
Stage Flash (MSF) & Reverse Osmosis (R/O) methods. Nevertheless, recently Qatar has made 
significant progress in reducing the emissions from the power & water sector, by introducing its first 
800 MW solar power plant, which shall be operational soon. It is the goal of the State of Qatar to 
expand these efforts and transform renewable energy into a key driver for ecological and commercial 
benefits. However, renewable energy solar power projects are facing considerable technical 
challenges related to the arid and dusty climatic conditions, grid stability issues in the integration with 
the existing system, reliability, power quality & control issues, etc. 
The National Program for Conservative & Efficient use of Water & Electricity (Tarsheed) has been 
successful in generating a lasting awareness over the issue of water and energy wastage, especially 
among the youth, and in reducing consumption of electricity & water per capita. It has ambitious aims 
for further reductions. Led by Qatar Foundation, Education City and the Qatar Green Building 
Council, efforts are being made to enhance the demand-side energy efficiency, energy savings, and 
local energy generation through rooftops solar panels. So far, the Tarsheed program has been 
successful in optimizing consumption of electricity & water and has ambitious aims for further 
reductions.  
Energy efficiency measures such as district cooling and energy labeling for all electronic devices are 
systematically being deployed and play a growing role in the national economic diversification 
strategy by reducing energy intensity and the need for energy subsidies, while also mitigating the 
overall GHG emissions of households and small & medium enterprises. Qatar has implemented 
several specification improvement standards for electrical and electronic equipment such as air 
conditioners resulting in significant savings in electricity consumption. Parallel to the multitude of 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
6 
energy conservation measures, Qatar has also introduced several water-conservation measures which 
will significantly improve the ecological footprint of the sector.  
The initiative to phase out incandescent lamps and adoption of Energy Efficient lighting has 
contributed in a major way for conservation of Energy and thereby GHG emissions reduction in the 
State of Qatar. 
 
Qatar is considered a pioneer in the field of district cooling (DC). District cooling relies on large-
scale centralized cooling that provides a wide spectrum of savings in energy consumption and 
infrastructure. It consequently reduces impact on the environment. The DC system operations are 
essentially linked to the electricity and water consumption. The continuous improvements in both 
electricity and water management practices substantially contribute to the environmental 
sustainability of the receiving housing and public buildings. 
Lastly, Qatar has continuously strived to upgrade its sewage treatment plants to produce treated 
effluents suitable for purposes such as landscaping, fodder crops irrigation, district cooling, 
construction industry use, etc. 
c) Transportation 
The transportation sector in Qatar has been earmarked for rapid modernization. The Doha Metro and 
Lusail Tram are major milestones in the development of public transportation and subsequent 
reduction of emissions from this sector. The level 3 accreditation status for Hamad International 
Airport is another major initiative towards sustainability. The country has also taken significant 
strides to adopt electrification of on-road vehicles by committing to electrify its public transport 
system and investing in installation of charging infrastructure across the country.  
Transition from ICE vehicles to EV and providing necessary infrastructure for EV chargers will 
contribute in a major way for GHG reduction and thereby NDC goals. Electrification has also been 
adopted in port operations e.g. reducing emissions at Hamad port using electric tractors. Going 
forward, gradual adoption of Euro 6 emission standards for vehicles and promoting a shift towards 
electric vehicles for private use shall constitute key initiatives to reduce emissions from the 
transportation sector. 
 
d) Building, Construction & Industry 
Qatar has been transforming its building standards towards higher sustainability levels through the 
adoption of the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) standards. The number of projects 
registered for GSAS certifications has been rapidly increasing thereby facilitating the transition 
towards green buildings. The Qatar Green Building Council has been advising hotels on higher 
environmental standards for energy and water savings, and has certified an increasing number of 
hotels, in line with the new hotel classification system implemented by the Qatar Tourism Authority 
(QTA) which has set new and higher sustainability standard. 
Hamad International airport is another success example of the recent GSAS implementation initiative. 
In its  plans for the second expansion phase, the terminal building will be the first airport in the MENA 
region to achieve a 4-star Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) rating, which is the first 
performance-based system in the MENA region, developed for rating the green buildings and 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
7 
infrastructures. The terminal will also be a LEED Silver certified building with innovative measures 
of energy efficiency across the entire building. 
A steadily growing number of projects to install solar panels on residential buildings are being 
undertaken by the private sector. Qatar plans to promote decentralized renewable energy production 
and use in buildings while also making more efficient their energy consumption. The ongoing 
development of Lusail city is Qatar’s main initiative concerning smart and sustainable cities with 
centralized water, cooling, waste, and transport systems as well as solar energy production. 
Qatar has been making a steady progress towards attaining circular economy in the construction 
sector by implementing recycling and re-using construction waste and the government further plans 
to explore the use of environment friendly battery-powered generators for construction activities.  
 
e) Research and Development  
Research and development initiatives in climate change in Qatar are conducted by a number of 
universities and institutions. Qatar University (QU), the nation’s first university, has been doing its 
fair share in the field of environmental science & sustainable development. QU established the 
Environmental Science Center (ESC) in 1980 for preserving its rich marine and terrestrial biodiversity 
& cultural heritage. QU also has the Center for Sustainable Development (CSD) which focuses on 
research related to Food and Water Security, Renewable Energy, Natural Resource Governance, 
Algal Technologies, and Waste Management. Equally, QU has a rich undergraduate and graduate 
program covering environmental science and engineering in addition to sustainable development. 
Most recently, the University established its academic publishing house, namely the QU Press, which 
also signed the UN’s SDG Publishers Compact. QU Press puts the subject of environment among its 
priority publishing programs.  
Similar research activities are also conducted at Hamad Bin Khalifa University & its affiliated 
research institute, Qatar Environment and Energy Research Institute (QEERI), has released the first 
Qatar Solar Atlas, a tool that quantifies the country’s solar resource and geographical distribution as 
a first step towards accelerating the use of more solar energy across the country. In addition, the recent 
Air Quality Index and Inhalable Particulates Index to provide the local population with information 
on gas and particulate emissions in Qatar. Partnered efforts, with international research centers, are 
being made to develop economic ways of harnessing solar energy through both fundamental and 
applied research on materials. 
The Qatar Research, Development and Innovation Council (QRDI) focuses on key topics of 
sustainability in Qatar’s energy sector and in management of environmental, food and water 
resources. Meanwhile, the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF) is funding research for an efficient 
carbon management system at the national scale.  
The R&D stakeholders (universities, research institutes and private labs) are equally playing a vital 
role in spreading awareness on the topic of economic diversification by dedicating efforts to relevant 
research projects and prioritizing research topics, such as the development of the energy, water and 
food nexus economy.

f) Education 
Educational institutions are a key player in the steering and implementation of the national long-term 
climate change strategies via research, technology development, policies and regulatory frameworks, 
monitoring, measurements, evaluation, and incentive schemes. Education and awareness are key to 
changing the ongoing practices, fight climate change, adapt to it, and attract new talents. 
Since 1994, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education has introduced the “Eco School 
programs” initiative which promotes environmental education and awareness in primary and 
secondary levels. This is realized through parts of the curriculum covering climate change in 
combination with extracurricular activities. Building upon this legacy, the Ministry has also 
established a committee for sustainable development to enhance all activities in this sphere and 
address climate change through education. 
On a more applied level, the state of Qatar is eager to foster climate change education throughout the 
daily routines of educational institutions. This is illustrated by the plan for enhancing teachers’ 
training on climate change topics in order to enable educators to present the topics of sustainability 
and environmental development in an appealing manner to students, and to foster behavioral changes 
in the long-term. 
Also, all major university campuses in Qatar feature solar panels on building rooftops and policies to 
reduce energy consumption.  
Qatar Foundation (QF) is developing green campus and housing facilities which have a direct impact 
on the ecological footprint of facilities and additionally increases awareness and consciousness of 
students. Further projects include initiatives such as awareness campaigns advocating for banning 
single-use plastics in society and annual collection campaigns. By means of initiatives like these, the 
State of Qatar is developing a generation that is aware of climate change and capable of limiting its 
own carbon footprint and to develop sustainable countermeasures. Also, the Education City in QF, 
which is an extensive campus with a world class national library, several branches of leading 
international universities, schools and research centers, has been developing a strategy to implement 
solutions for a more sustainable educational complex. The Education City tram, for instance, now 
connects 24 designated tram stations across 11.5 km and runs on hybrid energy storage (HES). 
Moreover, non-educational institutions, such as the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy 
(SC) and Kahramaa, play an active role in spreading awareness and raising the level of responsibility 
about climate change and matters related to it within the community, with a strong focus on youth. 
g) Tourism  
Tourism is another key sector identified by Qatar to diversify its economy beyond the oil & gas sector 
and increase private sector participation in the national economy. Qatar’s long-term strategy to 
develop tourism in the country has already yielded dividends with increases in the number of tourists 
in the country from all over the world. The development of the country’s first eco-resorts and major 
events like the FIFA World Cup 2022 and the Asian Games 2030 are set to further enhance the 
touristic appeal of the country while driving its socio-economic growth in a sustainable manner. 
Qatar’s tourism strategy promotes sustainable tourism and aims to reduce dependence on 
hydrocarbon resources for economic growth.

4. Adaptation actions with Mitigation Co-benefits  
a) Water Management  
Qatar depends mostly on seawater desalination for urban water supply, often using energy-intensive 
technologies. In the future, it is essential to reduce the consumption of both power and water per 
capita and use less energy-intensive technologies throughout the entire value stream. 
Qatar has also introduced several water-conservation measures which will significantly improve the 
ecological footprint of the sector. Most initiatives were started in 2015 and are ongoing, therefore 
considerable savings have been achieved, which will continue to improve the ecological footprint of 
the country. 
Besides the implementation of a new and ambitious water conservation regulation, several other 
measures have been started, e.g., increasing awareness via messages to residential customers with 
high consumption, retrofitting and replacing aerators in governmental facilities and switching to 
treated sewage effluent (TSE) for irrigation in parks. Additionally, savings are increasingly made by 
using recycled water in district cooling, the construction industry, and for a growing number of other 
usages. 
Efficient water management is a key adaptation measure. Therefore, Qatar has also invested 
significantly in this field. As a result, treated sewage effluent (TSE) volume in 2015 amounted to 194 
million cubic meters or around 98.2% of total wastewater. Nearly 66 million m3 were used in 
agriculture, around 31 million m3 in the irrigation of green landscapes and public parks, and about 57 
million m3 in deep injection into the non-freshwater aquifer.  
Moreover, as part of the development of Qatar’s Water Plan and Strategy, the National Water Policy 
was developed as the draft of the National Water Law and its executive by-law have been finalized. 
Furthermore, a draft law to regulate groundwater wells drilling has been completed. 
On biodiversity, Qatar is restoring marine habitats, particularly growing mangrove trees, and planting 
indigenous trees in urban areas and hence increasing the potential for carbon sequestration.  
b) Infrastructure 
Qatar has committed itself to formulating a comprehensive urban development plan and a sustainable 
urbanization and population distribution policy. The plan, which comprises detailed strategies and 
operational aspects, is guided by the National Vision 2030 as a general framework. 
The potential impacts of climate change on the Qatari coastal zone areas is currently being studied. 
A detailed analysis is carried out combining climate information based on historical trends for short-
term time horizons and projections of mean sea level rise by the end of the century. Sea level rise is 
considered the main driver of change but not the only one in the analysis. The results of the impacts 
of climate change along the Qatari coast for the horizon years 2040 and 2100 is based on the analysis 
of the future changes of several coastal impact indicators.  
The adaptation studies focused on identifying the most relevant socio-economic systems, natural 
ecosystems, and the most pertinent coastal impacts affecting the identified systems. Also, the 
evaluation of the coastal impact indicators, and ranking of the values in four levels (negligible, low, 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
10 
medium and high), based on a threshold of future changes previously defined are conducted. 
The principal impacts considered to affect the systems above are flooding, erosion, port operations, 
structural reliability, and coral bleaching. The drivers responsible for these impacts are changes in 
waves, storm surge, mean sea level, wind intensity, and sea surface temperatures. 
In addition, the National Development Strategy-1 (NDS-1) (2011-2016) provided a more detailed 
perspective and promoted an efficient economic and technical use of natural resources, provision of 
infrastructure services, and enhancement of market efficiency. The NDS-2 (2018-2022) was created 
to build upon the achievements of NDS-1, particularly with regards to the infrastructure development 
sector, storage, sanitation and treated wastewater networks, information and communication 
technology (ICT), construction materials, logistics, and construction. 
The State of Qatar has undertaken/planned several projects to enhance the overall infrastructure in 
the country with a strong focus on sustainability. Besides the sustainable stadiums being developed 
for the FIFA World Cup 2022, several other projects such as the Qatar integrated rail project, 
expressway program, roads and drainage program, development of sustainable residential complexes 
(Lusail city, Msheireb downtown), development of parking bays, inter alia hold key to Qatar’s plans 
of sustainable infrastructure development. 
c) Awareness  
Raising awareness is important for the creation of a shared understanding which is required to 
effectively rally resources and stakeholders for joint problem-solving. Traditional methods such as 
media campaigns will be used to spark attention and broad engagement initiatives will be applied to 
anchor the topic of climate change deeper in society.  
Many institutions in the community have been advocating for the topic of climate change by 
organizing and contributing to the establishment of periodic events. The biannual WISH conference, 
organized by Qatar Foundation, for example, fosters educated dialogue about health-related topics, 
where climate change effects are a central focus. Other institutions like Hamad Bin Khalifa University 
and Texas A&M University have also organized events including “12th International Exergy, Energy 
and Environment Symposium (IEEES-12)” and “Energy Education of the Future Forum” where 
multidisciplinary discussions are encouraged to put in play perspectives related to sustainability 
focused topics: Oil & gas Technologies, Smart Grids, Green and Electrified Transportation, 
Alternative and Clean Fuels, Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies, Desalination Technologies, 
Sustainable Agriculture, Waste Water Treatment and Environmental Technologies, etc. 
To target behavioral changes in the community by raising awareness about climate change, 
institutions like Qatar Foundation, for example, are initiating regular practices that encourage the 
adoption of more sustainable habits. The Foundation has established campaigns like, the “think before 
you print,” “save at your desk,” and “Paperless office,” that encourage employees on changing 
printers’ settings to minimize waste and incentivize users to further reduce the energy consumption.  
The TARSHEED Community awareness activities focuses on various conservation campaigns and 
basic training at school level, along with the KAHRAMAA awareness park for general public, is 
aimed to illustrate to the community the importance of sustainable development, and for inception of 
ideas for younger generation for behavioral changes 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
11 
Other organizations like the Qatar Green Building Council (QGBC) has established a project under 
the name of “no paper day” in 2013, that aims to encourage the local community to adopt eco-friendly 
initiatives geared at reducing waste nationwide and to remind the public that reducing the use of 
Qatar’s resources not only can improve business efficiency, but also help to preserve the 
environment’s long-term health. The initiative is part of QGBC’s efforts to help schools, companies, 
and institutions, find ways to reduce paper, plastic and metal consumption, engage the wider 
community in environmentally friendly practices, and raise sustainability awareness. 
d) Food Security  
Qatar has launched a robust national food security strategy to optimize the use of the country’s 
agricultural land and water resources and insulate domestic food needs from external shocks. This is 
increasingly important especially as rising weather-related disasters could disrupt the yields and 
provision of major crops, impacting Qatar’s already challenging agriculture landscape. The strategy 
focuses on four pillars of enhancing international trade and logistics, increasing domestic self-
sufficiency in some niches, building strategic reserves and enhancing domestic markets.  
Under the first pillar of international trade and logistics, Qatar is geographically diversifying trade partners 
for critical commodities to reduce exposure to external shocks. In addition, Qatar has also proactively put 
in place contingency plans to limit impacts of trade shocks or other exogenous disruptions.  
Qatar has also made huge strides to increase the domestic self-sufficiency of its vegetables, red meat 
and fisheries production, as well as reducing groundwater-based fodder production. For vegetables 
production, it has plans to develop its hydroponics greenhouse cluster to reach 70% self-sufficiency 
on greenhouse vegetables and has launched multiple programs and subsidies towards greenhouse 
production. Such initiatives will not only ensure that the country is well adapted to potential shocks, 
but also contribute towards more sustainable agriculture practices including better optimization of 
agrochemicals usage and water efficiency. This should also help decrease the transportation CO2 
footprint of the food offered in the country. 
Qatar also plans to put in place adequate reserves, including perishables, selected non-perishables, 
potable water and groundwater reserves to buffer against potential production disruptions. Lastly, it 
is also building transparency and efficiency in its domestic market through farmer support programs, 
food waste programs and food standards governance initiatives.  
5. Response Measures 
Due to its dependence on oil & gas export revenue, there is a potential adverse impact to Qatar’s economy, 
population welfare & the quality of life, resulting from implementation of response measures to climate 
change by developed countries. This is particularly true if such measures & policies affect international 
trade. In view of this, Article 4.10 of the Convention stipulates that due care must be taken by 
developed countries in the implementation of the commitments, particularly for those developing 
country Parties, with vulnerable economies that are prone to the adverse effects of the implementation 
measures. This applies notably to developing Parties like Qatar with economies that are highly 
dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export, and/or consumption of 
fossil fuels and associated energy-intensive products. Qatar’s developing economy requires various 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
12 
forms of international cooperation in this regard to achieve the goals and objectives of sustainable 
development in line with the principles and provisions of the Convention, particularly, Article 4.8 (e & h) 
& Article 4.10. 
6. Timeframe 
The intended voluntary contributions in this report tend to cover the period 2021 to 2030 in line with 
Qatar’s National Vision (QNV 2030). The target is defined as a single year target for 2030. 
7. Monitoring and Reporting Progress  
Governed by the MME Climate Change Department, the National Measurement, Reporting and 
Verification (MRV) System will be designed to measure and validate progress towards the 
commitments made in this NDC, using verified sector specific MRV communications prepared by 
the national stakeholders. Effective MRV processes are key to guarantee best practice accounting, 
transparency, precision and comparability on climate change information. The three pillars of Qatar’s 
MRV process are as follows: 
Measurement requires the derivation of data for a national GHG inventory and estimation of national 
GHG emissions through both direct measurement using devices, complemented by calculations and 
estimates. In order to ensure high quality of the data, all calculations will follow strict guidance using 
IPCC guidelines for National GHG inventories. 
Reporting refers to compilation of required reports, submission to respective stakeholders (i.e. 
UNFCCC) and preparation of the necessary documentation of measurement results to inform all 
interested parties. In order to achieve a high level of transparency, the reporting does not only include 
results but also methodologies, assumptions and data. 
Verification is essential for a thorough MRV process and incorporates review and validation of the 
generated data and reports by third party accredited entities to ensure the quality of measurement and 
reporting. Review will be conducted, and findings will be incorporated into the MRV process to 
ensure continuous improvement.  
8. Means of Implementation  
Qatar is already facing challenges of climate change, experiencing extreme climate conditions and 
events. The country welcomes technical assistance and capacity building designed for developing 
country Parties under the Convention. The international community’s efforts to transfer and deploy 
advanced sustainable development technologies are crucial to mitigate GHG emissions and enhance 
adaptive capacities. Qatar supports the development and operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement to serve as a driver for sustainable development. 
International cooperation in renewable energy systems, downstream specialty-chemicals, hydrogen 
fuels and technologies, energy efficiency technologies, waste management, sustainable agriculture 
 
           Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)  
13 
and national policies and measures are vital for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. 
 
 
9. Fairness and Ambition 
This NDC is based on the provisions and principles of the Convention in particular Article 3 
paragraph 2, Article 4 paragraph 1, paragraph 8 (e & h), and paragraph 10. 
All national actions and plans described in this NDC are voluntary and the means of implementation 
and support will be in accordance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change Articles 4.7, 12.4. 
Qatar’s commitments are in line with the requirements set forth in Articles 4.3 and 4.4 of the Paris 
Agreement and Decision 1/CP.21. To the relevant extent, this submission considers guidance set forth 
in Decision 4/CMA.1. In keeping with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change and Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, Qatar will continue to explore pathways to 
further enhance its emission reduction objectives in line with climate science and global ambition. 
Qatar reserves the right to further elaborate and update this NDC in line with its special national 
circumstances and sustainable development imperatives with a view to avoid the adverse effects of 
economic and social consequences of response measures.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target.

NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a

Contribution 
 
1. Targets to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
 
The Russian Federation participates in the implementation of the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter - the Convention), the Kyoto 
Protocol of December 11, 1997 and the Paris Agreement of December 12, 2015. 
As part of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Russian Federation 
announces a target for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, which provides for a 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to 70 percent relative to the 1990 level, 
taking into account the maximum possible absorptive capacity of forests and other 
ecosystems and subject to sustainable and balanced social economic development of 
the Russian Federation. 
This indicator demonstrates an increasing ambition compared to earlier 
commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
Thus, in the first period of the Kyoto Protocol, the Russian Federation ensured 
that the established indicator for limiting greenhouse gas emissions did not exceed 
100% of the 1990 level. Until 2020, the target for limiting greenhouse gas emissions 
was set on its own initiative by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation 
2 
 
No 752 dated September 30, 2013 ""On the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions"" and 
is no more than 75% of the 1990 level. 
The preliminary Nationally Determined Contribution, announced in 2015 in 
support of the Lima Call for Climate Action, was to limit anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions in the Russian Federation to 70-75 percent of 1990 emissions by 2030, 
taking into account the maximum possible absorption capacity forests. This indicator 
is intended to demonstrate the importance of protecting and improving the quality of 
sinks and sinks of greenhouse gases, as mentioned in Article 5 of the Paris Agreement. 
The first Nationally Determined Contribution of the Russian Federation is 
consistent and provides for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70 
percent by 2030 relative to the 1990 level, taking into account the maximum possible 
absorptive capacity of forests and other ecosystems and subject to sustainable and 
balanced socio-economic development of the Russian Federation 
This indicator is determined based on the need to ensure the economic 
development of the Russian Federation on a sustainable basis, as well as to protect and 
improve the quality of sinks and storage facilities of greenhouse gases and is aimed at 
achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
 
2. Target areas for the implementation of the global goal of adaptation to climate 
change 
 
Since the mid-1970s, the average annual surface air temperature in the Russian 
Federation has been growing by an average of 0.47°C over 10 years, which is 2.5 
times higher than the growth rate of the average global air temperature (0.18°C during 
10 years). 
Over the territory of the Russian Federation, large-scale consequences of climate 
change, which have a significant and increasing impact on the socio-economic 
development of the country, living conditions and health of people, natural 
ecosystems, as well as on the state of economic facilities are observed and predicted. 
In this regard, a national climate change adaptation system is being formed in the 
Russian Federation, based on the following principles: 
 
1) differentiated approach, taking into account: 
 
natural-climatic, socio-economic and technological specifics of adaptation 
of various sectors (spheres) of the economy and regions of the country; 
 
the effectiveness of adaptation measures at different levels of decision-
making; 
 
varying degrees of readiness of the subjects of climate policy 
implementation to develop and implement adaptation measures; 
3 
 
 
2) staging and consistency of the planning process, implying the presence of 
stages of development and implementation of adaptation plans with their 
harmonization, synergy of their elements, regular adjustment and supplementing them 
with new elements; 
 
3) the integrity of planning, assuming: 
 
preventive (proactive) adaptation aimed at reducing the risk of climate 
change (for example, the construction of dams against floods, forest protection belts, 
expansion of drought-resistant crops, etc.); 
 
post-crisis adaptation, providing for minimizing the consequences of the 
negative impact of specific manifestations of climate change, including related 
emergencies (evacuation of the population, liquidation of consequences, vaccination, 
temporary resettlement, and others); 
 
adaptation to direct (real and expected) and indirect consequences of 
climate change for the population, infrastructure and economy; 
 
harmonization and integration of adaptation plans (consistency and 
complementarity of preventive and post-crisis adaptation measures), as well as 
adaptation plans at the federal and regional levels; 
 
the planning hierarchy, including the priority of the national plan, the 
fulfillment of the goals and objectives of which are subject to other federal and 
regional adaptation plans, concretizing and detailing the national plan in the 
corresponding dimensions (sections); 
 
monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation measures and adjusting them 
(if necessary); 
 
adequate scientific and technological support for climate change 
forecasting and climate services. 
The National Action Plan for the first stage of adaptation to climate change, 
approved by the order of the Government of the Russian Federation dated December 
25, 2019 No. 3183-r, for the period up to 2022 provides for the following: 
 
formation of the necessary methodological and statistical base; 
 
determination of priority measures to adapt economic sectors and spheres 
of government to climate change (transport, fuel and energy complex, construction, 
housing and communal services, agro-industrial complex, fishing, nature management, 
health care, industrial complex, technical regulation, foreign and domestic trade, 
ensuring the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population, civil defense, 
protecting the population and territories from natural and man-made emergencies, 
activities in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation); 
 
determination of priority measures for adaptation of regions to climate 
change; 
4 
 
 
preparation of a national action plan for the second stage of adaptation 
(for the period up to 2025). 
 
3. Voluntary support for developing countries to achieve the goals of the Paris 
Agreement 
 
The Paris Agreement provides developing countries with continuous and 
enhanced international support to implement the provisions of Articles 4, 7, 9, 10 and 
11. In this context, the Russian Federation, in its declaration of acceptance of the Paris 
Agreement, noted that, as a Party to the Convention, it is not listed in Annex II. 
Nevertheless, the Russian Federation, realizing the importance of preserving the 
climate and ensuring sustainable development, plans to continue to assist developing 
countries in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, including mitigating 
anthropogenic impact on climate and adapting to the consequences of its change. 
The Russian Federation carries out joint projects, including scientific and 
technical cooperation in the field of climate, environmental protection, resource and 
energy conservation, with various developing countries, including the most vulnerable 
to the effects of climate change. Such joint projects are most actively developed within 
the framework of cooperation with the CIS countries, BRICS and ASEAN. 
The Russian Federation intends to continue its voluntary participation in the 
provision of international assistance to eliminate the consequences of natural disasters, 
including natural and climatic ones, as well as in financing the activities of the Trust 
Fund “Russian Federation - United Nations Development Program” (within the 
framework of the thematic area “Climate window ”), the Green Climate Fund and 
other institutions for sustainable development. 
The Russian Federation contributes to the global reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions by increasing the peaceful use of nuclear energy in developing countries, 
which helps to reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 
the period until 2030, the implementation of technological projects will continue in 12 
countries of the world, including Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh, 
Armenia, Iran, India and China. In addition, international scientific and technical 
cooperation is developing on improving the energy efficiency of buildings and 
structures, resource conservation and the use of renewable energy sources in 
construction in developing countries. 
In addition to the designated areas, the Russian Federation will continue, within 
the framework of relevant international agreements, to strengthen capacity in 
developing countries through the training of qualified specialists in climatology, 
meteorology, hydrology and oceanography. 
5 
 
Factual information on the support provided to developing countries in the 
context, including the objectives of the Paris Agreement, is reflected in the Biennial 
Reports of the Russian Federation submitted in accordance with decision 1/CP.16 to 
the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, and in the National Communications 
submitted in accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Convention and Article 7 of the 
Kyoto Protocol to the Convention. 
 
4. Information on the implemented climate policies 
 
The system of views on the goal, principles, content and ways of implementing 
the unified state policy of the Russian Federation on issues related to climate change 
and its consequences is reflected in the Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation, 
approved by the order of the President of the Russian Federation of December 17, 
2009 No. 861-rp. 
The Russian Federation is concentrating its efforts on reducing anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and increasing their absorption, including the 
implementation of the following measures: increasing energy efficiency in all sectors 
of the economy, developing the use of non-fuel and renewable energy sources, 
protecting and improving the quality of natural sinks and storage of greenhouse gases, 
financial and tax stimulating the reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
Measures to improve energy efficiency are provided for by the Federal Law of 
November 23, 2009 No. 261-FZ ""On Energy Saving and on Increasing Energy 
Efficiency and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation"" 
and a comprehensive action plan to improve the energy efficiency of the Russian 
economy, approved by order of the Government of the Russian Federation of April 19, 
2018 No. 703-r. 
In accordance to the Concept for the formation of a monitoring, reporting and 
verification system for greenhouse gas emissions in the Russian Federation, approved 
by order of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 716-r dated April 22, 2015, 
the current assessment system will in the future be supplemented with a monitoring, 
reporting and checking the volumes of greenhouse gas emissions at the level of 
organizations, as well as the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, which are 
recommended to organize an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and removals on 
their territory. 
In 2014-2017, a methodological base was formed, which is necessary for the 
implementation of the Concept (including methodological recommendations and 
guidelines for the development of indicators for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 
economic sectors, quantifying the volume of greenhouse gas emissions by 
organizations carrying out economic and other activities, conducting a voluntary 
6 
 
inventory of the volume emissions of greenhouse gases in the constituent entities of 
the Russian Federation, calculation of the volume of indirect energy emissions of 
greenhouse gases and determination of the volume of absorption of greenhouse gases). 
The national standardization system includes 3 standards related to the 
management of greenhouse gas emissions at the level of organizations (complies with 
ISO 14064, 2007 version). In 2021, the updating of these standards will be completed 
and new standards will be developed that are identical to ISO 14067:2018 
(requirements and guidelines for quantifying the carbon footprint of products) and 
ISO 14080:2018 (structure and principles of methodology on climate impact).

5. Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals 
 
a) Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA 
Anthropogenic emissions and removals of greenhouse gases are 
accounted for in accordance with methodologies and common 
metrics assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change and approved by the Conference of the Parties serving 
as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement. 
Methodological consistency is maintained between the 
12 
 
12 
communication and implementation of the nationally determined 
contribution, including with respect to the baseline. 
b) Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for the implementation of policies and measures or 
strategies in the nationally determined contribution 
International reporting on the implementation of policies and 
measures or strategies under the nationally determined 
contribution will take into account the impact of measures taken 
between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2030. 
c) If applicable, information on how the Party will take into 
account existing methods and guidance under the Convention 
to account for anthropogenic emissions and removals, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 14, of the Paris 
Agreement, as appropriate 
When accounting for anthropogenic emissions and removals of 
greenhouse gases, the Russian Federation promotes 
environmental integrity, as well as ensures transparency, 
accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency in 
accordance with the decision of the Conference of the Parties to 
the UNFCCC 24/CP.19. 
The avoidance of double counting is ensured through periodic 
technical reviews of national reporting in accordance with the 
decision of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC 
13/CP.20. 
d) IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals 
The first NDC uses the metrics of the 4th IPCC Assessment 
Report. 
The use of the metrics of the 5th IPCC Assessment Report is 
planned in the second and subsequent NDCs after their 
approbation in the preparation of the National Inventory 
e) Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, 
methodologies and approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, 
as appropriate, including, as applicable: 
i) Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent 
removals from natural disturbances on managed lands 
When estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gases, 
approaches are not used to eliminate emissions and subsequent 
absorption of greenhouse gases as a result of extreme natural 
anomalies on managed lands. To account for emissions and 
removals of greenhouse gases from the carbon pool of harvested 
13 
 
13 
ii) Approach used to account for emissions and removals 
from harvested wood products 
iii) Approach used to address the effects of age-class 
structure in forests 
wood, an atmospheric flux approach is used in accordance with 
the IPCC methodological guidance. The impact of natural 
changes in the structure of age classes in forests on the offset of 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals is minimized, given that 
the historical level of 1990 is used as a baseline 
f) Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
i) How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference 
level(s), including, where applicable, sector-, category- or 
activity-specific reference levels, are constructed, including, 
for example, key parameters, assumptions, definitions, 
methodologies, data sources and models used

on how the climate forcers are estimated 
iv) Further technical information, as necessary 
Not applicable 
g) The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of 
the Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The Russian Federation recognizes the importance of voluntary 
cooperation in nationally determined contributions to potentially 
increase the ambition of mitigation and adaptation actions. 
The possibility of using voluntary cooperation in the 
implementation of the nationally determined contribution will be 
considered by the Russian Federation following the adoption by 
the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
14 
 
14 
Parties to the Paris Agreement of the rules, conditions and 
procedures for the mechanisms referred to in Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement. 
 
6. How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances 
 
a) How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances 
During the first period of the Kyoto Protocol, the Russian 
Federation ensured that the established indicator to limit 
greenhouse gas emissions did not exceed 100% of the 1990 
level. Until 2020, the target indicator to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions was set in a proactive manner by Decree of the 
President of the Russian Federation No. 752 dated September 
30, 2013 “On the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions” and is 
no more than 75% of the 1990 level. 
The Intendent Nationally Determined Contribution, tentatively 
announced in 2015 in support of the Lima Call for Climate 
Action, was to limit anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 
the Russian Federation to 70-75 percent of 1990 emissions by 
2030, accounting for the maximum possible absorption capacity 
forests. This indicator is intended to demonstrate the importance 
of protecting and improving the quality of removals and sinks of 
greenhouse gases, as mentioned in Article 5 of the Paris 
Agreement. 
The first nationally determined contribution of the Russian 
Federation is consistent and calls to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to 70 
percent compared to the 1990 level, taking into account the 
maximum possible absorptive capacity of forests and other 
15 
 
15 
ecosystems and subject to sustainable and balanced socio-
economic development of the Russian Federation. 
This indicator was determined based on the need to ensure the 
economic development of the Russian Federation on a 
sustainable basis, as well as to protect and improve the quality of 
sinks and storage facilities for greenhouse gases.

7. How the nationally determined contribution contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in 
its Article 2 
 
a) How the nationally determined contribution contributes 
towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in 
its Article 2 
The nationally determined contribution of the Russian 
Federation contributes to the achievement of the goal of the 
Convention, since it is a fair and real contribution to the 
stabilization of the global concentration of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere (taking into account the efforts already made to 
limit greenhouse gas emissions) and does not pose a threat to the 
economic development of the Russian Federation on a 
sustainable basis 
b) How the nationally determined contribution contributes 
towards Article 2, paragraph 1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, 
of the Paris Agreement 
The nationally determined contribution of the Russian 
Federation contributes to the achievement of the global 
temperature target, since by 2030 the cumulative reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions of the Russian Federation since 1990 
is to exceed 55 billion tonnes of CO2-eq.

II. Adaptation communication,  
as a component of the Nationally Determined Contribution 
 
(in accordance with decision 9/CMA.1 of the Conference of the Parties, 
serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement) 
 
 
а) National circumstances, 
institutional arrangements and 
legal frameworks 
The Climate Doctrine of the Russian Federation, approved by the order of the President of 
the Russian Federation dated 17.12.2009 No. 861-rp, defines the strategic goal of the national 
climate policy to ensure the safe and sustainable development of the Russian Federation, 
including institutional, economic, environmental and social, including demographic, aspects 
development in a changing climate and the emergence of related threats. 
The main principles of climate policy are: 
the global nature of the interests of the Russian Federation in relation to climate change 
and their consequences; 
priority of national interests in the development and implementation of climate policy; 
clarity and transparency of climate policy; 
recognition of the need for action both within the country and within the framework of a 
full-fledged international partnership of the Russian Federation in international research 
programs and projects related to climate change; 
comprehensive accounting of possible losses and benefits associated with climate change; 
precaution in planning and implementing measures to ensure the protection of people, the 
economy and the state from the adverse effects of climate change. 
The National Climate Policy considers among the priorities: 
- timely identification and assessment of threats to sustainable development and security 
of the Russian Federation related to climate change, 
- proactive adaptation to the consequences of climate change. 
17 
 
17 
Measures to adapt to climate change are provided for by decisions of state authorities, 
taking into account the international agreements of the Russian Federation. 
Planning, organization and implementation of measures to adapt to climate change are 
carried out within the framework of the state policy in the field of climate, taking into 
account the sectoral, regional and local characteristics, as well as the long-term nature of 
these measures, their scale and depth of impact on various aspects of the life of society, the 
economy and the state. 
b) Impacts, risks and 
vulnerabilities, as appropriate 
The current climate change in Russia as a whole is characterized as ongoing warming at a 
rate more than two and a half times the average rate of global warming. According to 
estimates obtained using modern climate models, throughout the 21st century. Russia will 
remain a region of the world where climate warming is significantly higher than average 
global warming. 
The observed and expected future climate changes on the territory of Russia cause 
numerous and, often, important - negative and positive - consequences for natural and 
economic systems, as well as for the country's population. 
The negative consequences of the expected climate change for the Russian Federation 
include: an increase in health risk (an increase in the level of morbidity and mortality) of 
certain social groups of the population; an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of 
droughts in some regions, extreme precipitation, floods, waterlogging dangerous for 
agriculture - in others; increased fire hazard in forests; degradation of permafrost in the 
northern regions with damage to buildings and communications; violation of ecological 
balance, including the displacement of some biological species by others; the spread of 
infectious and parasitic diseases; an increase in electricity consumption for air conditioning in 
the summer season for a significant part of settlements. 
Possible positive for the Russian Federation consequences of expected climate changes, 
which are associated with a significant potential for effective sectoral and regional economic 
development, include: reduction of energy consumption during the heating season; improving 
the ice conditions and, accordingly, the conditions for transporting goods in the Arctic seas, 
facilitating access to the Arctic shelves and their development; improvement of the structure 
18 
 
18 
and expansion of the crop growing zone, as well as increasing the efficiency of animal 
husbandry (subject to a number of additional conditions and the adoption of certain 
measures) increasing the productivity of boreal forests. 
c) National adaptation priorities, 
strategies, policies, plans, goals 
and actions 
 
A national system of adaptation to climate change is being formed in the Russian 
Federation. By order of the Government of the Russian Federation dated December 25, 2019 
No. 3183-r, the National Action Plan for the first stage of adaptation to climate change for the 
period up to 2022 was approved. The National Plan provides for: 
- formation of the necessary methodological and statistical base; 
- determination of priority measures to adapt economic sectors and spheres of government 
to climate change (transport, fuel and energy complex, construction, housing and communal 
services, agro-industrial complex, fishing, nature management, healthcare, industrial 
complex, technical regulation, foreign and domestic trade, ensuring the sanitary and 
epidemiological well-being of the population, civil defense, protecting the population and 
territories from natural and man-made emergencies, activities in the Arctic zone of the 
Russian Federation); 
- determination of priority measures to adapt regions to climate change; 
- preparation of a national action plan for the second stage of adaptation (for the period 
until 2025) 
d) Implementation and support 
needs of, and provision of support 
to, developing country Parties 
 
The Paris Agreement provides developing countries with continued and enhanced 
international support for the implementation of its provisions. In this context, the Russian 
Federation, in its statement on the adoption of the Paris Agreement, noted that, being a Party 
to the UNFCCC, it is not included in Annex II to it. 
Nevertheless, the Russian Federation, realizing the importance of preserving the climate 
and ensuring sustainable development, plans to continue to assist developing countries in 
ensuring the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement, including adaptation to the 
consequences of its change. 
The Russian Federation carries out joint projects, including scientific and technical 
cooperation in the field of climate, environmental protection, resource and energy 
conservation, with various developing countries, including the most vulnerable to the effects 
19 
 
19 
of climate change. Such joint projects are most actively developed within the framework of 
cooperation with the CIS countries, BRICS and ASEAN. 
The Russian Federation intends to continue its voluntary participation in the provision of 
international assistance to eliminate the consequences of natural disasters, including natural 
and climatic ones, as well as in financing the activities of the Trust Fund “Russian Federation 
- United Nations Development Program” (within the framework of the thematic area 
“Climate window ”), the Green Climate Fund and other institutions for sustainable 
development. In addition to the designated areas, the Russian Federation will continue, within 
the framework of relevant international agreements, to strengthen capacity in developing 
countries through the training of qualified specialists in climatology, meteorology, hydrology 
and oceanography.

Intended Nationally Determined Contribution
Communicated to the UNFCCC on November 18, 2015
1. The National Context
St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multi-island nation consisting of 32 islands each with its
own characteristics. It is located in the Eastern Caribbean and has a population of
approximately 110,000. St. Vincent is the largest of the 32 islands that comprise the nation,
covering roughly 390 sq. km (150 sq. miles). The Grenadines extend 72 km (45 miles) to the
southwest. The other inhabited islands, north to south, are Young Island, Bequia, Mustique,
Canouan, Mayreau, Union Island, Palm Island, and Petit St. Vincent. The Government of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines (GoSVG) ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1996 and the Kyoto Protocol in 2004. This INDC represents St.
Vincent and the Grenadines’ intention and has no legal status. Any form of commitment is
yet to be decided, pending the outcomes of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the
UNFCCC in Paris in December 2015.
The geography, geology and socio-economic circumstances of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines make it extremely vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters. Due to its
mountainous topography, most activities on the mainland are concentrated on the narrow,
low-lying coast line, at risk to sea-level rise (SLR) and coastal erosion while the landscape
also adds risks of landslides and flash flooding. An increase in severe weather events will
result in significant expenditures, which will further constrain St. Vincent and the
Grenadines’ social and economic growth.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines have suffered significant impacts over the past five years
(2010 to 20141) as a result of severe weather events. In total, the loss to the country was in
excess of US$600 million2 over that period, equating to approximately 35% of its Gross
1 Hurricane Tomas (October 2010); tropical storm (April 2011 and December 2013); two prolonged droughts
(2010 and 2014)

1Domestic Product (GDP). With per capita GDP amongst the lowest in the Caribbean3, severe
weather events caused by anthropogenic climate change will fundamentally restrict
economic development. The increased coastal erosion, droughts, storms, floods and
landslides of the last decade have severely impacted livelihoods and government have
neither the financial or technical resources to address these challenges.
Climate projections for St. Vincent and the Grenadines suggest an increase in average
atmospheric temperature; reduced average annual rainfall; increased Sea Surface
Temperatures (SST); and the potential for an increase in the intensity of tropical storms4.
There is currently no monitoring of sea level around St. Vincent and the Grenadines;
however observations from tidal gauges surrounding the Caribbean basin indicate that SLR
in the Caribbean is broadly consistent with the global trend.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in their 5th Assessment Report,
states the following projected changes over 2081–2100 (relative to 1986–2005) for the
Caribbean for an intermediate low-emissions scenario:
 a decrease in average annual rainfall of about 5–6%;
 a 1.2°C to 2.3°C median annual increase in surface temperature; and
 sea level rise projections in the region of 0.5 m to 0.6 m5.
With climate-related events already causing damage and loss, these projections have dire
implications for agriculture, water availability, and the protection of public and tourism
infrastructure if no meaningful action is taken.
Despite the obvious focus on adaptation to climate change and the fact that greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions from St. Vincent and the Grenadines only account for approximately
0.001% of global emissions6, the GoSVG is striving to reduce its emissions. As well as
developing a national Energy Action Plan, there is a comprehensive Mitigation Assessment
in the forthcoming Second National Communication. The largest contributor to reducing
emissions will be the installation of a geothermal electricity generation facility, which when
operational will provide over 50% of the country’s electricity needs. Further to this,
initiatives are underway to improve energy efficiency in buildings and transport as well as
reduce emissions from waste going to landfill.
St Vincent and the Grenadines would like to express its support for the Republic of China
(Taiwan) which has completed its own INDC despite not being a Party to the UNFCCC.
Taiwan has committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 50 percent compared to its business-
as-usual scenario by 2030 (20% lower than 2005). We, therefore, urge the UNFCCC to
consider the observership of Taiwan in this mechanism.

22. Mitigation
Economy-wide Contribution
St. Vincent and the Grenadines intends to achieve an unconditional, economy-wide
reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 22% compared to its business as usual
(BAU) scenario by 2025.
Figure 1: Projected BAU and ‘With Interventions’ GHG emission scenarios for St. Vincent and the
Grenadines
22%
While the proposed contribution is economy-wide and is in comparison to all sectors and
sources of emissions7, the contribution is based upon key measures in the energy (including
energy generation, energy efficiency and transport) sector. The following sections explain
the strategies and measures which will be undertaken to deliver the contribution.
The energy sector accounted for approximately 68% of St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ GHG
emissions in 20108 with projected further growth through to 2025, and is therefore the
focus of its mitigation activity. Within the sector, approximately 50% of emissions can be
attributed to energy generation and approximately 50% from transport. The following sub-
sector mitigation contributions have been identified:
i. Renewable energy: the plans for renewable energy generation are focused on the
development of the country’s proposed geothermal power plant (planned to be
completed in 2018). The facility, when complete, will generate approximately 50% of
the national annual electricity consumption needs. In addition to the geothermal

National Communication). This forms part of the Second National Communication Report, which will be
submitted to the UNFCCC shortly.
3plant, the national energy utility is renovating existing hydro power facilities to
improve efficiency and generation capacity as well as enabling and encouraging the
installation of small-scale photovoltaics (PV) in the private and public sectors.
ii. Energy efficiency: there is an objective to achieve a 15% reduction in national
electricity consumption9 compared to a BAU scenario by 2025. Planned measures in
this sector include the retrofitting of street lighting nationally, a new building code
and an energy labelling scheme for appliances.
iii. Transport: new policies to reduce the import duty paid on low emission vehicles are
in the process of being introduced to encourage their use. It is estimated that this
will result in avoided emissions of approximately 10% over the next 10 years10.
Significant potential for greater reductions (e.g. improved public transport) is
achievable if international finance can be made available, however this needs further
analysis to quantify the reduction potential and support required and consequently
these measures have not been included in the economy-wide contribution at this
stage. Currently, transport is the fastest growing source of emissions and reductions
from this sector will be largely dependent on international financial support and
technology transfer.
iv. Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF): St. Vincent and the Grenadines
intends to develop its GHG sinks though reforestation, afforestation reduced
deforestation and reduced forest degradation. At this stage, good quality data does
not exist for the forestry inventory, however this is in the process of being
addressed. Once the forestry inventory is compiled, policies and actions will be
developed for the sector, however the related contribution is not quantifiable at this
stage. Policies and actions may be delivered through mechanisms such as the ‘Clean
Development Mechanism’ (CDM) and ‘Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
Forest Degradation’ (REDD).

4Parameter Information
Estimated quantified impact on GHG Reduction in GHG emissions of 22% compared to its
emissions business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2025.
Business as usual methodology The following assumptions have been made to
generate the BAU scenario:
 Electricity supply – extrapolation of projected
energy demand 2015-201812
 Non-electrical energy supply - assumed to grow
consistent with population growth
 Domestic transport – extrapolation of historical
road vehicle numbers
 Municipal Solid Waste generation per capita –
assumed to grow consistent with population
growth
 All other sources (which are estimated together
to contribute less than 10% of GHG emissions)
have been assumed to increase in line with
population growth other than the LULUCF
sector, where no change is assumed from 2010.

5Parameter Information
St. Vincent and the Grenadines considers the use of
instruments for achieving and financing flexibly part
of its mitigation target. Therefore St. Vincent and
the Grenadines supports the inclusion of the
International Carbon Markets and mechanisms such
as the CDM in a post-2020 agreement on climate
change including the use of the mitigation outcome
pre-2020. We propose that such an instrument,
together with an appropriate accounting system
(MRV), is used to help finance low carbon and
climate resilient infrastructure investments. St.
Vincent and the Grenadines considers that certain
low emission development options mentioned in
this INDC, or additional actions, could be entirely or
partially funded by the transfer of international
carbon assets mobilized through bilateral, regional
and international carbon markets while taking into
account environmental integrity and transparency.
Metrics and methodology  Consistent with methodologies used in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines’ forthcoming

Assessment Report
4. Vulnerability and Adaptation
4.1 National programmes that support climate change adaptation
The economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines is strongly linked to its natural resources.
The country has a long history of coping with natural disasters and, through traditional land
cultivation methods and cultural association with the sea, Vincentians also have a long
history of natural resource conservation.
The St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013 -
2025 has been elaborated around a specific set of strategic goals, objectives and targets so
as to facilitate and guide the optimal improvement of the quality of life for all Vincentians.
The Plan, which encapsulates the issues of Rio and the post 2015 UN Development Agenda,
has been adopted by all Ministries and is used to guide programmes and activities.
In particular, Goal 4 of the Plan; ‘Improving Physical Infrastructure, Preserving the
Environment and Building Resilience to Climate Change’ seeks to ensure that St. Vincent and
the Grenadines develops its physical infrastructure, while preserving the country’s delicate
environment, as well as mitigating the effects of climate change. To reduce the adverse
impacts of climate change, the Plan proposes several adaptation measures to reduce future
6restoration costs and to protect the natural environment. Public education and awareness
of the potential negative effects of climate change are at the forefront of this Plan16. The
proposed strategic interventions include:
 Increase public awareness with regard to climate change issues;
 Build resilience to minimise damage to settlement and infrastructure;
 Minimise damage to beach and shoreline integrity and marine ecosystems;
 Minimise the negative impact of climate change on agriculture and human health;
and
 Develop appropriate legislative and regulatory framework, for proper environmental
management, and institutional systems for responding and mitigating effects of
climate change17.
4.2 Existing vulnerabilities in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors
Agriculture is one of the largest economic activities on St. Vincent and it contributes
significantly to the economic and social development of rural livelihoods in particular.
Offshore fisheries are also important and are predominately small scale and artisanal.
Tourism activities are concentrated in the Grenadines islands and all other livelihood
activities in these islands are inherently linked to tourism. Such livelihoods are vulnerable to
climate change impacts, as they are heavily dependent on the stability of the climate
conditions or natural resources.
The agriculture sector in St. Vincent is especially sensitive to extended periods of drought,
unevenly distributed rainfall and natural disasters when coupled with existing practices such
as mono-cropping and poor soil and water management. Three extreme climatic events
over a span of three years (2009 – 2011 inclusive) highlighted the vulnerability in this sector.
 In 2009 there was a water shortage resulting from drought conditions. Many
residents in Georgetown practise agriculture and farmers suffered losses from
reduced crop production that year. As a consequence, food prices rose and produce
had to be imported from other islands to supplement the limited supply in St.
Vincent.
 In 2010 hurricane Tomas resulted in losses totalling EC $35 million, mainly to banana
and plantain production.
 During the second week of April 2011 heavy rainfall caused rivers to overflow and
landslides in the north-eastern section of St. Vincent in a major agricultural area. This
occurred while the sector was still recovering from damages caused by hurricane
Tomas in the previous year.
4.3 Existing vulnerabilities in the tourism sector
Expected increases in the frequency or magnitude of certain weather and climate extremes
(e.g. heat waves, droughts, floods, tropical cyclones) as a result of climate change will affect
16 St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025
17 St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025
7the tourism industry through increased infrastructure damage, additional emergency
preparedness requirements, higher operating expenses (e.g. insurance, backup water and
power systems and evacuations) and business interruptions.
Results from the SLR modelling work conducted in 2011 indicate that 1 metre SLR places
10% of the major tourism properties at risk, along with 1% of road networks, 50% of airports
and 67% of sea ports. Engineered structures and natural environments (e.g. mangroves) can
protect against some of these impacts to coastal regions, but the dynamics of these erosion
processes will demand some adaptation of coastal infrastructure and settlements18.
4.4 Existing vulnerabilities in the coastal zone
More than 90% of the infrastructural development of St. Vincent and the Grenadines lies on
a narrow coastal belt less than eight meters above sea-level. These include the island’s main
communication and emergency response structures - roads, airports, telecommunication,
financial, and technical support centres19. Additionally, many of the coastal protection
ecosystems such as dunes, mangroves and reefs have been removed or are degraded, which
exacerbate vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to storm and hurricane activity
(particularly wind and storm surges).
4.5 Existing vulnerabilities in the water resources sector
Watersheds have also been affected by land degradation due to “squatting, mono-cropping
with poor agricultural techniques, global weather patterns (changes in rainfall distribution,
drought and elevated atmospheric temperatures), deforestation and excessive use of
agrochemicals”20.
Climate models suggest that the country will experience drying throughout the year (even
during the wet season). Further reduced rainfall would severely impact the water supply of
rivers and streams in St. Vincent and is of particular concern for the Grenadine islands which
have a very high dependence on rainwater for freshwater supply. An increase in the
intensity of rainfall in fewer rain days is also expected, which means that not only is the
country vulnerable to droughts, but also to the secondary effects of torrential rains such as
landslides and the contamination of water supplies.
4.6 Existing vulnerabilities in the health sector
Vector borne diseases may increase due to increased precipitation and temperatures in St.
Vincent and the Grenadines. In the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Strategic Plan For Health
2007 – 2012 it was stated that “National household and Breteaux indices continue to be
above and beyond internationally accepted levels”. Dengue is specifically mentioned21 but
malaria cases have also been reported. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health reported
1 imported case of malaria in 2008 and another in 2010. The Caribbean Environmental

8Health Institute (2007) has also stated that “There are serious issues related to availability of
water, health and sanitation in the context of vector control”22.
4.7 Efforts to adapt to climate change
A number of steps to address climate change related issues have been taken over the years
but now that such efforts are being integrated, it is timely that St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is revisiting its draft National Climate Change Policy to further give weight and
direction to its efforts in response to climate change.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has recognised the need to take an integrated approach to
adaptation by linking local activities with national policies and sector specific experiences.
Climate change adaptation activities have been mainstreamed into national development
planning (through the National Economic and Social Development Plan) and continues to be
a major focus and several actions have been identified to support resilience building at all
levels. The areas which have been incorporated within the plan include: culture, identity and
national pride; economic; social capital; governance; national security; energy, disaster
management and the environment; physical infrastructure and education,
telecommunications, science and technology23. The National Economic and Social
Development Plan possess nine over-arching goals including:
 High and sustained levels of economic growth;
 Reduced unemployment and poverty levels;
 Improved physical infrastructure and environmental sustainability;
 High levels of human and social development;
 Safe and secure nation;
 Technologically advanced work-force;
 Increase national pride and cultural renaissance;
 Regional integrity; and
 Enhanced global solidarity.
Future priorities will include the development of a public education framework, targeted at
providing a curriculum for climate resilient agriculture, based on traditional techniques and
expertise.
4.8 National climate change adaptation programmes
The main activities being implemented at the national level include the following:
1. The Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is the largest project in St. Vincent
and Grenadines specifically designed to address climate risk and resilience. The PPCR
proposes to enhance climate risk management through the following broad strategies:
a. Strengthen community resilience to cope with climate hazards;
b. Increase institutional capacity to undertake climate risk management;
c. Strengthen knowledge and awareness;
22 The CARIBSAVE Climate Change Risk Atlas (CCCRA)-St. Vincent and the Grenadines
23 St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025
9d. Prepare comprehensive hazard maps for public institutions and communities;
e. Design and implement gender sensitive disaster risk management initiatives; and
f. Collaborate with communities at all levels of climate and disaster risk
management.
The PPCR has four main components24:
Component 1: Climate vulnerability risk assessment and risk reduction. This component is
being piloted in Union Island, Arnos Vale Watershed and the Georgetown Watershed and
a range of data relative to other components has been collected.
Component 2: Data collection, analysis and information management. There are three
key aspects to this Component: the acquisition and installation of telemetric weather
stations and software; coastal zone impacts modelling and the development of a
harmonized platform for data analysis and data management.
Component 3: Comprehensive framework for strengthening of the existing policy, legal
and institutional framework to address Climate Change. This component seeks to
strengthen the existing policy, legal and institutional framework. It will commence with
comprehensive review of current policies, plans and legislative framework to improve
SPRC implementation in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. It will also involve finalising
various policies, drafting a disaster management plan and preparing and finalising an
Environmental Management Act and Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations.
Component 4: Design and implementation of a public education and capacity building
programme. This component will provide for a range of initiatives in support of public
and private sector capacity building. These include a national 3–year public education
programme to build community based climate risk and resilience, provide a national
curriculum for schools in climate change and disaster risk reduction, plan and develop an
early warning system for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, provide technical training and
extend the school risk assessment to cover all constituencies in the country.
4.9 Adaptation planning in the agriculture sector
Agriculture which for decades underpinned the economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
has declined significantly over the last decade due to restrictive trade regimes. This has
resulted in significant land use change as demand for housing is often met by developing
agricultural lands. However, the Government of St. Vincent has demonstrated its
commitment to agricultural diversification and through its policies and programmes. These
efforts include the following:
 Support for small scale farmers from the government, in production technologies,
agri-business management, good agricultural practices and pest and disease control;
policy initiatives to address climate change issues, environmental protection, risk
mitigation and fisheries development; and a national plan for dealing with food
security.
24 Strategic Programme for Climate Resilience: St. Vincent and the Grenadines Phase 1
10 An innovative project which abandoned land into a model for sustainable living and
farming systems in St. Vincent, young persons in local primary and secondary schools
are taught organic agriculture, environmental art and creative land use.
 The implementation of the National Forest Resources Conservation Plan (1994-2003)
and Integrated Forest Management and Development Programme to address issues
of rapid deforestation, limited involvement of communities in forest resource
management, weak institutional capacity, lack of an approved forestry policy
framework, fragmented environmental management and limited awareness of the
importance of forests to national development.
 Enhancing the adaptive capacity of rural economies and natural resources to climate
change through the management and protection of land based natural resources
and agricultural production systems.
4.10 Adaptation planning in the coastal zone
Coastal areas already face pressure from natural forces (wind, waves, tides and currents)
and human activities, (beach sand removal and inappropriate construction of shoreline
structures). The impacts of climate change, in particular SLR, will magnify these pressures
and accelerate coastal erosion. Areas at greatest risk in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are
Belmont Walkway, Canash Beach, Indian Bay, Johnson Point and Villa Beach including
notable resorts, ports and an airport that lies at less than 6 m above sea level and will
therefore be affected”25.
The country has started to promote itself as a dive destination and has signed on to the
Caribbean Challenge Initiative (CCI) with the pledge to protect 20% of its near shore marine
and coastal resources by 2020. Other initiatives include:
 Participating in the ‘Improving the Management of Coastal Resources and the
Conservation of the Marine Biodiversity in the Caribbean Region’ project which is
seeking to address marine resources management and strengthen capacity of
stakeholders through a common institutional framework for management of marine
protected areas (MPA) in the Caribbean Region.
 Formulating coastal zone related policies through the activities of the PPCR.
 Reducing climate change induced risks for the population through coastal protection
through various specific initiatives including:
o the Sans Souci Coastal Defence Project;
o At the Water’s Edge (AWE): Coastal Resilience in Grenada and St. Vincent and
the Grenadines (2011-2016) project; and
o Coastal Protection for Climate Change Adaptation in the Small Island States in
the Caribbean 2014-2018 project.
The Fisheries Division is proposing a Coastline Protection Project which would provide the
synergy with the Sans Souci Coastal Defence Project in terms of halting beach and cliff
25 The CARIBSAVE Climate Change Risk Atlas (CCCRA)-St. Vincent and the Grenadines
11erosion, stabilize the shoreline and restore the beach and near-shore reef. Additional
benefits are to attract and provide habitat for fish, lobster and other marine life.
4.11 Adaptation planning in the water resources sector
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has not devised a National Water Policy or Water
Management Plan but there is a Draft Road Map toward Integrated Water Resources
Management (IWRM) Planning for Union Island, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
Importantly, there are efforts that contribute to adaptation at the community and
household level. These initiatives are:
 The construction of Reverse Osmosis plant in Bequia.
 Rooftop rainwater harvesting systems have been installed through several projects:
o at 6 sites in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Sandy Bay Government School,
Georgetown Community Centre, Park Hill Primary School, Langley Park
Government School, Richland Park Government School and Liberty Lodge
Boys Training Centre). The beneficiary schools are also used as hurricane
shelters.
o For households in selected communities in St. Vincent to secure and provide
potable drinking water when there is water scarcity or shortage of water
available.
4.12 Adaptation planning in the health sector
The policy of the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is to provide universal
health care that reflects the principles of equity, affordability, quality, and cultural
acceptance for its citizens. Whilst there is no explicit action towards adapting the health
sector to climate change, The Millennium Development Goals, the Essential Public Health
Functions, and the Caribbean Cooperation in Health, Phase III, and other initiatives provide a
good basis for adaptation.
4.13 Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation
St. Vincent is a member of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency
(CDEMA) an inter-regional supportive network of independent emergency units that
responds to disasters wherever they occur in the region. The National Emergency
Management Organisation (NEMO) falls under the ambit of the Prime Minister’s Office.
In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, there is recognition of the importance of disaster
management to environmental management. In the National Environmental Management
Strategy and Action Plan, Principle 9 is to “Prevent and Manage the Causes and Impacts of
Disaster”26. Two strategies, with specific activities, are therefore designed to help NEMO
achieve this part of the environmental management plan. Strategy 29 is to “Establish at the
community and national levels, appropriate and relevant integrated frameworks to prevent,
26Homer & Shim, St. Vincent & the Grenadines Environmental Management Strategy and Action Plan, 2004
12prepare for, respond to, recover from and mitigate the causes and impacts of natural
phenomena on the environment and to prevent manmade disasters”27.
 Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction (RDVRP) Project 2011-2018 estimated to cost
US$20.92 million is addressing policy, data management, infrastructure and capacity
issues in the areas of Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management. It
seeks to measurably decrease the vulnerability of people and the national economy of
St. Vincent and the Grenadines to climate change and natural hazards.
 The Pilot Project on Climate Resilience (PPCR) is addressing mainly infrastructural
support in response to climate change and sea-level rise.
5. Fairness and Ambition
Despite its negligible contribution to global GHG emissions (approximately 0.001%) and the
fact that it is still a developing economy, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is taking significant
and ambitious steps to reduce its national emissions. The proposed, unconditional
contribution would result in a reduction in projected per capita emissions28 to 4.3 tonnes
CO e in 2025, which is less than the global average of 5.3 tonnes CO e emissions per capita
2 2
in 2025, the level required to be consistent with returning warming to below 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels29. This demonstrates that St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ ambition to
reduce emissions is significant and reflects a fair contribution in the global context for 2025,
while allowing the country’s economy to continue to develop.
6. Planning Process
The development of the INDC has involved detailed stakeholder consultation with public
and private sector experts to determine the level and type of contribution, how the
contribution will be achieved and identify the procedures that will see climate change
integrated into central institutional processes. This will be summarised by St. Vincent and
the Grenadines forthcoming Climate Change Policy. The Ministry of Health, Wellness and
Environment will be responsible for facilitating multilateral dialogue on climate change
issues as well as overseeing implementation of the INDC.
Elements of the INDC are already enshrined in the national agenda through the existing
‘National Social and Economic Development Plan 2013-2025’ (Strategic Goal 4), which
addresses the strategic necessity to adapt to the changing climate to protect its delicate
environment while reducing GHG emissions. The ‘National Physical Development Plan’ also
references the importance of energy efficiency in buildings and transport. The national
electricity utility provider, VINLEC, has also established a feed-in-tariff to encourage the
installation of distributed PV.
27 The CARIBSAVE Climate Change Risk Atlas (CCCRA)-St. Vincent and the Grenadines
28 Estimated to be 5.4 tCO2e per capita in the BAU scenario
29 The global target to avoid 1.5°C of warming is 5.3 tCO2e per capita in 2025, assuming a global population of
8.1 billion
(http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=Health%20Nutrition%20and%20Population%20Sta
tistics:%20Population%20estimates%20and%20projections) and global emissions of 43 GtCO2e
(http://climateanalytics.org/files/ca_briefing_benchmark_emissions_1p5_and_2oc_2020_2025_2030_201502
10_final_bh_may.pdf)”.
13Whilst the report has been prepared as partial fulfillment of the country’s obligations to the
UNFCCC, there are many domestic benefits of developing and implementing an INDC. St.
Vincent and the Grenadines’ INDC clearly demonstrates its political commitment and help
realize non-climate benefits that support developmental priorities, in particular, reduced
spending on imported fossil fuels. Additionally, these actions are consistent with the
strategies and programmes identified in the Climate Change and the Caribbean: A Regional
Framework for Achieving Development Resilient to Climate Change endorsed by the
CARICOM Heads of State.
7. Means of Implementation
St. Vincent and the Grenadines has shown its commitment to mitigating climate change by
independently taking concrete measures to reduce its emissions, particularly through
renewable energy and waste initiatives30. It is hoped that this commitment and ambition
will be recognised by the international community as progressive (in the context of the
country’s SIDS status) and that it will enable the country to leverage international finance
(through the Green Climate Fund for example), technology transfer and capacity-building
support to help further reduce emissions, especially in the areas of transport, renewable
energy and energy efficiency.
In particular, St. Vincent and the Grenadines would welcome financial and capacity-building
support to help produce a Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) for the
country’s transport sector. This is a key priority if national GHG emissions are to be
stabilised and reduced over the coming years. Similar international support in capacity-
building and finance for the LULUCF sector is also sought to help establish a related
programme of mitigation actions.
Despite the injection of funds to the country through the PPCR, the need for financing
climate change adaptation and mitigation in St. Vincent and the Grenadines remains
significant. This is especially so considering the extent of vulnerabilities and the percentage
of the population potentially exposed. Devastating losses already being experienced and
projected climate change impacts suggest that mobilizing additional, adequate and timely
financing is vital to the country’s socio-economic development.
30 Facilities for waste segregation have been put in place, however to date little segregation has been
achieved.

Submission of San Marino to the ADP
San Marino, 30 September 2015
San Marino's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution
Introduction
The Republic of San Marino, as a party of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), is fully committed to the negotiating process aimed at reaching a global legally
binding agreement applicable to all Parties at the Paris Conference in December 2015 in line
with keeping global warming below 2°C.
San Marino hereby communicates its intended nationally determined contribution and the
accompanying information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding, with
reference to decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20.
Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC)
The Republic of San Marino, on the basis of the decision of the Government held on 28
September 2015, commits to reduce GHG emissions to 20% below 2005 levels by 2030.
In line with the Lima Call for Climate Action, in particular paragraph 14, the Republic of San
Marino shall submit the following information for its INDC.
Information to facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding
Quantifiable information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year):
Base year: 2005
Emissions in base year: 0,213 Mt per year (provisional, will be defined through the next
inventory submissions).
Time frames and/or periods for implementation:
Time frame of the commitment is until end 2030. This quantified commitment will be
translated into a progressive commitment over the period.
1REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO
Scope and coverage:
Gases covered: all greenhouse gasses not controlled by the Montreal Protocol: CO2, CH4,
N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3
Sectors covered: energy; industrial processes and product use; agriculture; land-use, land-
use change and forestry; waste.
San Marino supports the inclusion of international aviation and shipping on the basis of
future internationally agreed rules applicable to all parties.
Net Contribution of International Market Based Mechanisms:
The Republic of San Marino intends to achieve its goals of reducing emissions exclusively
through domestic measures. However, the use of international mechanisms based on the
market is not excluded if domestic reductions will prove insufficient to achieve the targets
set.
Planning processes:
Since 2008 environmental policies have been implemented with a view to improving energy
performance of buildings, production of electricity from renewable sources, energy
consumption reduction. Moreover, a virtuous policy has been undertaken in waste
management, reduction of solvent emissions into the atmosphere and application of new
technologies in agriculture and land use including through a more careful territorial
planning.
These policies will continue to be implemented in the coming years.
Assumptions and methodological approach:
Metric Applied Global Warming Potential on a 100 year timescale in accordance with the
IPCC's2th Assessment Report.
Methodologies for Estimating Emissions: IPCC Guidelines 1996, IPCC Guidelines 2006 and
IPCC 2013 KP Supplement.
Fairness and ambitions of the INDC:
San Marino contribution to global emissions is 0,00052%. Nevertheless, San Marino
undertakes to achieve a reduction of emissions in line with the goal of keeping global
warming below 2° C.
2REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO
The population country is still increasing, 10% in the last 10 years. This increase has a
consequence on the energy consumption.
National Circumstances
With an area of 61.19 km2 and a population of about 32,500 inhabitants, the Republic of San
Marino is one of the smallest and least populous countries in the world. Its territory includes
about 10 km2 of woods and 28.6 km2 of agricultural areas. It is located in Southern Europe
and is an enclave in central Italy.
The Republic of San Marino ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) on 5 July 1994 and the Kyoto Protocol on 21 January 2010, as a non-
Annex I country without quantified commitments for reducing the GHG emissions.
Furthermore, San Marino accepted the Doha Amendment on 20 July 2015.
San Marino economy is based on small- and medium-sized enterprises. Tourism is thriving,
with over 2 million tourists every year. The country has a modest agricultural sector, which
offers high quality and genuine products and a well-diversified banking and financial sector.
In 2013, the GDP of the Republic of San Marino was equal to 1,357.1 million euro,
corresponding to 40.462 euro per inhabitant.
In 2014 the country’s energy needs were equal to 259 GWh of electricity and 45 Gg of fuels.
The Republic of San Marino is totally dependent on energy imports since it has neither fossil
fuel sources nor energy production plants.
The small territory of San Marino has a limit access to renewable energy options such as
hydroelectric, wind or geothermal power. As a consequence, in the last years, the

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC-STP) Updated
2021São Tomé, 2021
This NDC update has been possible thanks to the technical and financial support by:I. Introduction
Sao Tome and Principe (short, STP) is an African small island developing state (SIDS). Located in the
Gulf of Guinea, the country is composed of two islands and various smaller islands and islets, with a
total area of 1001 km2. Today, the country’s population stands at about 215,000, with 65% living
below the poverty threshold and about 30% lives without electricity. In 2019 the unemployment rate
was close to 13.4%, while GDP growth stood at 4.5%, underlining its insufficiency in fulfilling the
developmental needs. More than 90% of the State General Budget originates from external aid, and
the debt level is also very high, at about 70% of GDP. These physical and socio-economic
susceptibilities make Sao Tome and Principe very vulnerable to adverse climatic events.
STP’s high vulnerability is in deep contrast to its greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emission status since
its territory is as an absolute carbon sink contributing to global CO removals. In September 2015, STP
2
communicated its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) under the Paris Agreement.
In addition, as a member of the Paris Agreement, STP will follow its transparency requirements; in
other words, STP will participate in international biennial reporting and review cycles regarding GHG
emissions, NDC implementation, as well as updating its NDC every five years. Consequently, STP’s
participation in the Paris Agreement and the implementation of its ambitious NDC measures will
require financial resources from external sources, access to technology, and training.
The approved 2006 National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), in conjunction with the 2015
INDC and other documents produced in recent years - in the absence of the National Adaptation Plan
(NAP) - constitute the basis for the country’s presentation of this revised and updated NDC proclaiming
a broad sectoral approach with more ambitious measures and goals in relation to the 2015 NDC.
Equally, STP will adopt an enhanced MRV (Measurement, Reporting and Verification) system
guaranteeing transparency and co-ordination within the Paris Agreement framework and
strengthening its capabilities in data gathering and revision, consolidating its institutional framework,
including the strengthening of the National Climate Change Committee and training of its members.
STP seeks the acceleration of its NDC implementation in line with its Sustainable Development
Objectives (SDGs) agenda.
With the support of the NDC Partnership, the Government of STP elaborated in 2018 the NDC
Implementation Plan to advance the mitigation and adaptation components of its NDC. The NDC
Implementation Plan builds off national and sectoral priorities and was designed through an economy-
wide and whole-of-society approach including government institutions, NGOs, private sector,
international partners, and academia. The Plan serves as a planning, coordination, transparency, and
resource mobilization tool for the Government and is being implemented with the support of national
and international stakeholders.
STP’s nationally determined contribution (NDC), under the terms of Article 4 of the Paris Agreement,
represents a commitment towards mitigation and adaptation. Moreover, STP is set to track mitigation
and adaptation proposals following the requirements of the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)
foreseen in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement, detailed in decision 18/CMA 1. By implementing its
contribution, STP offers the international community an alliance with its national objectives of both a
post-COVID-19 pandemic green recovery and an opportunity to consolidate a more prosperous future
by taking advantage of vast opportunities in pursuing low-carbon and resilient development.
1The present NDC adheres to information, clarity, transparency and understanding (ICTU)
requirements, in line with decision 4/CMA 1 as adopted at the 24th Conference of the Parties (COP 24).
STP’s updated NDC is more ambitious and presents improvements in relation to its 2015 NDC (GHG
reduction was at 57 ktCO eq). In fact, mitigation contributions, with a total GHG reduction goal of 109
2
ktCO eq, represent additional reduction of these gases of approximately 90% (equivalent to about 51
2
ktCO eq). This increase in ambition is reflected also by the increase in the number of measures set
2
forth in relation to mitigation, adaptation, and cross-sectoral measures. The number of measures rose
from 18 to 29 compared to 2015, especially targeting the increase of renewable energy generation
from 26 MW to 49 MW, as well as the increase in energy efficiency. The number of sectors covered is
more comprehensive as they now include the energy, transport, fishery, agriculture, livestock farming,
forestry, water, and waste sectors civil protection.
The elaboration of this updated NDC is the result of a participatory and consultative process involving
key ministries, public and private sectors stakeholders, experts, civil society organisations as well as
marginalised and vulnerable groups.
II. NDCs – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC-STP)
Mitigation Component
The mitigation measures currently identified as contributions by STP are:
i. An increase in renewable energy share integrated in the national grid;
ii. a reduction in power grid losses and increase of energy efficiency; and,
iii. a significant reduction in the transport sector’s carbon footprint.
With the implementation of these measures, STP will be able to contribute towards an estimated GHG
emissions reduction of 109 kTCO eq, corresponding to a 27% emission reduction by 2030, with a total
2
estimated cost of close to USD 150M.
The goal to reduce emissions is conditional to the availability and mobilization of external funding with
the aim of reducing projected emissions in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios by 2030. The
projected emissions are comprehensive for the entire country and cover all economic sectors,
excluding the land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sector given the country’s climate
neutrality estimated in initial GHG emissions inventory calculations.
Adaptation Component
With regard to adaptation, the NDC implementation plan’s objective is to reduce climate-related risks
and increase the resilience of communities and sectors by strengthening technical and institutional
capacities, mainstreaming climate resilience into national and subnational planning and budgeting,
and several investments.
The plan covers the agriculture, livestock, forestry, energy, transport, coastal zones, fisheries, water
and the civil protection sectors.
2Based on data from the NDC-STP, on its implementation plan and on the implementation of other
national plans, stakeholders have identified the priority measures; their reformulation and integration
embedded in a set of programmatic actions, as presented in the table in Chapter V, as well as its
quantifiable goals. The latter will be made available in the NAP as of 2023.
III. Means of Implementation
Taking into consideration the national circumstances together with its financial incapacity to
implement mitigation, adaptation and cross-cutting measures contained in its updated NDC, STP will
need to resort to international financing in the form of grants or concessions to enable the country to
comply with its updated NDC. Recourse to these financial mechanisms -- created or implemented by
the UNFCCC, by the Paris Agreement and by development partners- serve to promote the elaboration
and implementation of projects and programmes, technological transfer, and capacity-building.
The cost of reaching STP’s NDC’s mitigation goals is estimated at 150 million USD. This estimate solely
covers project and programme implementation and does not include policy implementation, studies,
nor the elaboration of preliminary studies to inform projects and programmes. The cost of
implementing adaptation measures will be detailed in STP’s future National Adaptation Plan (NAP).
This document will develop follow-up, monitoring and transparency verification mechanisms with
regard to the use of financial flows.
Other instruments, to be communicated to the Convention and under the Paris Agreement - BURs,
NCs, BTRs and NDCs - will also report on the needs on international co-operation support received, as
well as on its utilization, and they will be based on a robust and transparent national methodology
enabling continuous and consistent monitoring.
With these tools and initiatives, Sao Tome and Principe will develop its long-term climate finance
strategy based on the correct identification of its needs and priorities.

617/11 establishes the creation of a disaster management entity, CONPREC, the National Council

Building off the national and sectoral plans and comprehensive consultations, in 2018, the
country elaborated, with support from the NDC Partnership, a NDC Implementation Plan to
drive mitigation, adaptation and crosscutting components of its NDC. The NDC Implementation
Plan serves as a planning, coordination, transparency, and resource mobilization tool for the
Government and is being implemented with support from national and international
stakeholders.

Gender policy.
c) Other contextual aspirations and priorities Population projections put the current (2021) Santomean female population at 108,342 or,
acknowledged when joining the Paris Agreement. 50.48% of the total population. In reality as also in the various studies have demonstrated that,
traditionally, Santomean women have been marginalised in every aspect of life when
compared to men. The Government has committed to integrate gender issues and women
empowerment, as evidenced by several official documents on policy orientation and strategy.
The concerns to adequately respond to the efforts arising from these promises have led the
Government and its various development partners to adopt policies for implementation of
7plans, programmes and projects designed to eliminate or reduce inequalities while promoting
and empowering Santomean women.
The National Strategy for the Promotion of Gender Equality and Equity (ENEIG) is the most
important among several initiatives establishing both policy orientations and a strategy design
focused on expediting the achievement of these objectives. ENEIG’s first five-year strategic
plan began in 2007, while the current five-year plan, elaborated in 2019, will run through 2026.
To the already difficult toll on the lives of women and girls lacking equity and equality, climate
change is an added challenge. Thus, the current and third strategic 5-year plan is promoting a
new approach, based on “STRATEGY 8 – THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE”, to lessen
the consequences of ever more difficult climate challenges for women and girls, to promote
gender integration in the water and hygiene sector, as well as to facilitate access to and
management of natural resources, management of natural disasters, environmental cleanup,
and climate action and the promotion of sustainable energy. The aim is to increase mitigation
and adaptation participation by and integration of vulnerable groups. A singularly important
decision adopted by the Government is the integration of gender issues into its various
budgetary components, allocations and sectoral programmes.

Agreement global GHG emissions. Therefore, all contributions from Sao Tome and Principe in the area of
mitigation are conditioned by the financial and technological support it may receive from
abroad, as well as by the support received for strengthening of its capacities. However, in the
spirit of increasing ambition and in order to demonstrate STP's commitment to combat global
warming, the country is committed to develop a ""finance tracking methodology"", to be
officially approved by STP government entities, which will allow the definition and presentation
of unconditional mitigation actions from a subsequent NDC, that is, in 2025. In addition, it is
noted that, for the period of implementation of this NDC, through the effort made by the
Santomean government and with the kind contribution of international partners9, it will be
possible to reduce from 5 KtCO e to 30 KtCO e by the year 2030, considering the already
2 2
pledged financial support to be provided.
7 “1. This Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention, including its objective, aims at strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change,
in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by: Holding the increase of global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would reduce the risks and impacts of climate
change.”
8 1. In order to achieve the long term temperature goal set out in Article 2, Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognising
that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance
between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of
sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.”

1KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its commitment to Paris Agreement goals and achieving mitigation co-
benefits through economic diversification and adaptation. The Kingdom will implement actions, projects, and
plans outlined in this submission that aim at reducing, avoiding, and removing GHG emissions by 278 million
tons of CO eq annually by 2030, with the year 2019 designated as the base year for this NDC. This ambition is
2
more than a two-fold increase versus the previous one as outlined in the Kingdom’s INDC (130 million tons of
CO eq). Thus, this submission represents progression and the highest possible ambition.
2
The ambitions set in this NDC are contingent on long-term economic growth and diversification with a robust
contribution from hydrocarbon export revenues to the national economy. Through its Vision 2030, the Kingdom
has already instigated a comprehensive set of unprecedented reforms in the public sector’s operating model,
the economy, and society as a whole. The new ambition is also premised on the assumption that the economic
and social consequences of international climate change policies and measures will not pose a disproportionate
or abnormal burden on the Kingdom’s economy (Paragraph 2 of Article 3 of the UNFCCC).
The Kingdom has embarked on a comprehensive and highly ambitious set of measures to realize its climate
ambitions using the Circular Carbon Economy Framework.
The Kingdom is developing and implementing holistic and harmonized programs, policies, initiatives, and
collaboration platforms to address climate change challenges at the national, regional and global scale. Examples
include the Saudi Green Initiative, the Middle East Green Initiative, the Circular Carbon Economy National
Program, the National Renewable Energy Program, and the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program. The Kingdom is
also a member and active participant of major international initiatives such as Global Methane Initiative, Mission
Innovation, Clean Energy Ministerial, and Net-Zero Producers Forum.
2KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
1. NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Physical, economic and social factors are the main determinants of the vulnerability of a country to climate
change. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia exhibits significant vulnerability in all three aspects. As an arid country
with a harsh climate and sensitive ecosystem, Saudi Arabia is particularly vulnerable to climate change. About
76% of its area (including 38% as deserts) is non-arable land. The average annual rainfall in the Kingdom is low.
Renewable surface water resources are limited while the Kingdom lacks rivers and lakes. Groundwater from
local aquifers (mostly non-renewable) is the major water supply source for domestic, agricultural and industrial
purposes. Thus, water scarcity is common and changes in the water balance would have serious implications for
the desert ecosystem, agriculture, industry and other sectors.
Oil production, processing and export are the primary economic activities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The
reliance on limited income resources puts at risk its ability to maintain a level of growth in the long run, hence
economic diversification is a key factor influencing the stability and sustainability of the Kingdom’s economic
growth. In 2016, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has embarked on Vision 2030 which charts out the path for
economic diversification and a prosperous future in all development areas.
Since the inception of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia took an active
part in related consultations and has pledged its commitment to meet these goals. Central to all sustainable
development plans and programs is an economic diversification designed to diversify the Kingdom’s sources of
national income and reduce dependence on revenues from limited sources by increasing the share of other
sectors in gross domestic product. These sectors include the manufacturing industries, energy, energy-related
derivatives, mining, tourism, logistics, and information technology industries.
2. NDC Ambition
The Kingdom aims at reducing and avoiding GHG emissions by 278 million tons of CO eq annually by 2030, with
2
the year 2019 designated as the base year for this NDC. This ambition is more than a two-fold increase versus
the previous one as outlined in the Kingdom’s INDC (130 million tons of CO eq). Thus, this submission represents
2
progression and the highest possible ambition.
This NDC is driven by the aim to implement measures that accelerate the economic diversification process under
Section 3 below (Scenario 1). Estimates and ambitions will be adjusted depending on the level of development
and progress toward economic diversification as well as feedback from different sectors of the economy.
3. DYNAMIC BASELINES
Two scenarios for determining dynamic baselines for the period 2020–2030:
Scenario 1: Economic diversification with a robust contribution from hydrocarbon and its derivatives export
revenues. Export revenues channeled into investments in high value-added sectors such as financial services,
3KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
medical services, tourism, education, renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies to enhance
economic growth. Ambitions outlined in this NDC are set under this scenario.
Scenario 2: Accelerated domestic industrialization based on sustainable utilization of hydrocarbons. A heavy
industrial base built to use domestic energy resources as feedstock or energy source abated with best suitable
technologies. Increasing contributions of petrochemical, cement, mining and metal production industries to
the national economy. In this case, this NDC will be adjusted to account for this scenario.
The main difference between the two baseline scenarios is the allocation of hydrocarbons produced for either
domestic consumption or export. While exported hydrocarbons will not contribute to the GHG emissions of
Saudi Arabia, the domestic consumption will increase its GHG emissions. For the ex-ante estimations, the
baseline is determined based on differently weighted combinations of the two scenarios.
4. CONTRIBUTION TO ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION WITH MITIGATION CO-BENEFITS
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has embarked on a series of comprehensive economic reforms with sustainability
as one of its core pillars. The NDC will be achieved by the deployment of various actions and plans as described
below.
4.1 ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The Kingdom’s energy efficiency strategy, policies, measures and initiatives actively promote and support
mitigation co-benefits across the economy. The Saudi Energy Efficiency Center runs an Energy Efficiency Program
targeting three main sectors that account for 90% of the national energy demand: industry, building and land
transportation. Its initiatives include progressively stringent efficiency standards in all three sectors.
Numerous initiatives will be implemented to improve and raise the efficiency of energy consumption in the
targeted sectors including improving the efficiency of home appliances and air conditioning units, improving the
efficiency of feedstock utilization in key strategic sectors such as petrochemicals, improving transportation fleet
fuel economy, phasing out inefficient used light-duty vehicles, implementing aerodynamic regulation for heavy-
duty vehicles, and improving the thermal efficiency of power generation, transmission, and distribution.
The National Energy Services Company (Tarshid) was established to incentivize energy efficiency in government
buildings and private sector investment in energy efficiency services. It plans to retrofit the entire pool of public
and governmental assets and facilities which include 2 million street lights, 110,000 government buildings,
35,000 public schools, 100,000 mosques, 2,500 hospitals and clinics.
4.2 RENEWABLE ENERGY
Power Sector: Renewable energy projects will contribute to the diversification of the energy mix used in
electricity production. Thus, the renewable energy ambition aims to reach around 50% of the energy mix by
2030. Through the National Renewable Energy Program, the Kingdom will implement a set of comprehensive
4KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
reforms, regulations and policies to stimulate private sector investment, research and development,
employment in renewables. The program sets out a roadmap to diversify local energy sources, stimulate
economic development and establish the local renewable energy supply chain and industry. The Kingdom will
seek to localize a significant portion of the renewable energy value chain in the Saudi economy, including
research & development and manufacturing. Specific technologies for deployment include solar PV,
concentrated solar power, wind, geothermal energy, waste to energy and green hydrogen.
Green Hydrogen: Using its high-yield solar and wind resources, the Kingdom is uniquely positioned to become a
global leader in green hydrogen production. The Kingdom’s flagship giga-project, NEOM, will be building one of
the world’s largest green hydrogen facilities. The plant will be powered by over four gigawatts of renewable
energy from solar and wind. Once onstream by 2025, it is expected to produce 650 tons per day of green
hydrogen by electrolysis and 1.2 million tons per year of green ammonia.
4.3 CARBON CAPTURE UTILIZATION & STORAGE
Capturing CO emissions at the point source for conversion into value-added products or storage in geological
2
reservoirs is a critical technology for the Paris Agreement goals.
The Kingdom is planning to build upon its experience in the CO Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) project and its
2
world’s largest carbon capture and utilization plant as part of the National Circular Carbon Economy Program.
CCUS Hubs: To advance the uptake of CCUS technologies and scale up its deployment, the Kingdom plans to
transform Jubail and Yanbu into global hubs for carbon capture, utilization and storage. The hubs will leverage
the concentration of the manufacturing industry, proximity to sinks and transport infrastructures. Jubail and
Yanbu are homes to the regional petrochemicals, steel and other heavy industries. Both cities represent the
economy of scale opportunity when it comes to reducing, reusing, recycling and removing GHG emissions.
Blue Hydrogen: In addition to green hydrogen, due to the abundance of natural resources, underground carbon
storage capacity and CCUS technology expertise, the Kingdom has the potential to become a world-leading
producer of blue hydrogen. The Kingdom is developing a National Hydrogen Strategy to chart pathways to
become a global leader in the hydrogen industry. With associated carbon emission captured, utilized and/or
stored in geological formations, blue hydrogen can be utilized domestically in various industrial sectors. Pilots,
research and demonstrations will be prioritized to improve technology maturity and lower costs in the aviation,
shipping, petrochemicals, and steel industries.
4.4 UTILIZATION OF GAS
As part of reforms of its domestic energy sector, the Kingdom aims to increase the utilization of natural gas in
its energy mix. By 2030, the Kingdom aims that up to 50% of its electricity generation is expected to be met by
natural gas significantly lowering the carbon intensity of domestic energy generation.
5KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
4.5 METHANE MANAGEMENT
Considering its global warming potential, methane emission management is central to climate change action.
The Kingdom plays a world-leading role in methane management in the energy sector. The methane
management measures include zero flaring in the oil and gas industry, recovery and subsequent utilization for
power generation and petrochemicals production. The Kingdom as a member of the Global Methane Pledge
initiative will collaborate with other members to reduce global methane emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to
2020 levels.
5. CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADAPTATION
Taking into account the environmental factors of the region, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is continuously
investing considerable efforts and resources in activities that help protect and renew its natural environment
including biodiversity of land, seas and coastlines. Saudi Arabia differentiates its adaptation measures into those
with mitigation co-benefits and those that are entirely aimed at adaptation and raising resilience. Adaptation
measures also contribute to economic diversification. The NDC in this area is driven by the aim to implement
measures that will enhance resilience and accelerate economic diversification.
5.1 ADAPTATION WITH MITIGATION CO-BENEFITS
The following adaptation measures are expected to have significant mitigation co-benefits:
5.1.1 Water and wastewater management
Water scarcity in the region presents various challenges to the economic and social growth of Saudi Arabia.
Implementing adaptation actions related to water management presents opportunities to reduce exposure and
vulnerability.
Desalination of seawater provides about 70% of potable (domestic) water supply in the Kingdom. The Kingdom
is taking a number of steps in deploying desalination technologies to minimize the GHG emissions in the form
of co-benefits from this sector leading to saving of energy from this sector. These steps include:
a. Reverse Osmosis (RO) technology: The Kingdom is gradually replacing the conventional energy-
intensive multi-stage flash (MSF) and multiple effect distillation (MED) technologies by lower energy
consuming RO technology, reducing the energy consumption in this sector. RO is approximately 30%
less energy-intensive than the conventional MSF and MED technologies.
b. Renewable Energy for Seawater Desalination: NEOM city will be using renewable energy resources
such as solar, wind and green hydrogen for the seawater desalination for their potable water needs.
c. Minimizing Leaks in the Potable Water Distribution System: Old water distribution network will be
replaced with a new water distribution network to minimize the leakages in order to save desalinated
potable water avoiding increasing the production capacity of the existing plants or avoiding the need
for new desalination plants.
d. Increasing the use of treated wastewater: The Kingdom is working on expanding the wastewater
collection, treatment and reuse to augment the need for potable and groundwater in city greening
6KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
and in agriculture. This will help reducing the need for potable water (desalinated water) for city
greening and groundwater for agriculture.
e. Rain Water Harvesting: Encouraging rainwater harvesting to augment the need for potable and
irrigation water.
f. Storage of Surface Water Runoff: Increasing the storage of surface water runoff through constructing
new dams in the country.
g. New Irrigation Techniques: Employing new irrigation techniques such as surface irrigation, drip
irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, subsurface irrigation, and other techniques will minimize the use of and
save a substantial amount of precious groundwater used for agriculture.
5.1.2 Marine Protection
The Kingdom will implement coastal management strategies that are designed to reduce coastal erosion,
increase the sinks for blue carbon, maintain related ecosystems and address the threats that climate change
poses for marine livelihoods. The Kingdom supports the planting of mangrove seedlings along its coasts. In
addition, the Kingdom strengthens and enhances the coral reef restoration program throughout the
northwestern Arabian Gulf. Saudi Arabia’s new generation coral reef restoration technologies accelerator aims
to develop innovative technologies that enhance the thermal resilience of coral reefs and provide cost-effective
options to scale up reef restoration by bringing together national stakeholders. Several studies were conducted
to estimate the outtake of mangroves and other blue carbons for the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. These studies
will be utilized in estimating a more accurate blue carbon sinks.
5.1.3 Reduced desertification / Tree Planting
The region suffers from desertification. Saudi Arabia undertakes measures to enhance desertification
management: actions that promote the stabilization of sand movements around cities and roads while
increasing sinks capacity through using green belts as barriers; develop and enhance arid and semi-arid rural
areas through various natural resource conservation activities, biodiversity and ecosystem-based adaptation
efforts. The objective is to improve soil quality, water, pasture and wildlife resources through a system of
protected areas and reserves. Adaptation with mitigation co-benefits may include measures of planting trees to
combat desertification, reducing and improving land management practices, especially for agriculture and
forestry.
Tree planting and rehabilitating hectares of land over this decade as part of the Saudi Green Initiative. Recycled
water from an irrigation network will be used for this purpose. The greening initiative will lead to mitigation co-
benefits that can be estimated through approved methodologies.
5.1.4 Urban Planning
The Kingdom is taking actions to develop mass transport systems in urban areas such as the development of the
metro and bus network in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam, which will provide significant sustainability,
environmental and public health benefits. The Kingdom already started construction of metro in Riyadh and in
the process of making it operational. The newly built Riyadh metro and bus network will save thousands of car
journeys and liters of fuel daily. In addition, Saudi Railway network will be expanded to connect major cities and
7KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
ports which will result in reductions in traffic and GHG emissions. Approved methodologies will be used to
estimate avoided GHG emissions.
As part of Vision 2030, the Kingdom has launched a series of giga-projects aimed at reimaging all aspects of
urban development. As an example, NEOM introduces a new model for urban sustainability powered by 100%
renewable energy. Development that spans 26,500 km2 adopts environmental responsibility principles and
promotes sustainable and regenerative development practices. It acts as a world-scale laboratory of future-
proof urbanization. The project will develop the LINE, a city of a million residents with a length of 170 km that
aims to preserve 95% of nature within NEOM, with zero cars, zero streets, zero carbon emissions and to be
powered by 100% renewable energy and green hydrogen.
5.2 ADAPTATION UNDERTAKINGS
The following adaptation contributions are expected to support Saudi Arabia’s efforts to address climate change
and raise resilience to its impacts:
Integrated Coastal Zone Management Planning (ICZM): Take the necessary action to develop and implement
ICZM plans that would take into account the protection of coastal infrastructures such as roads, residential
areas, industrial complexes, desalination plants, seaports, etc.;
Early Warning Systems (EWS): Develop and operationalize EWS that would reduce vulnerability due to extreme
weather events such as rainstorms, floods and dust storms by increasing resilience of infrastructure;
Integrated Water Management Planning: The kingdom has limited reserves of exploitable non-renewable
groundwater and low recharge rates (2.8 bcm in Arabian Shield) due to arid conditions. The Saudi National Water
Strategy 2030 aims to work towards addressing all the key challenges, leveraging previous and on-going studies,
and reform the water and wastewater sector to ensure sustainable development of water resources while
providing affordable high-quality services. Strategic programs and initiatives include laws and regulations,
management, innovation and capacity building, and service quality.
Infrastructure and Cities Designs: Put in place the necessary policies to make cities and infrastructure more
sustainable. Improving the cities design by increasing the efficiency of buildings by making them more resilient
to heatwaves.
6. RESPONSE MEASURES
The social and economic welfare losses arising from climate change response measures will increase the
vulnerability of economic diversification and adaptation initiatives of the Kingdom. Additionally, the
opportunities for addressing key requirements for achieving sustainable development.
As a developing country with limited sources economy, the Kingdom considers the management of response
measures as one of the building blocks of its NDC implementation. The Kingdom recognizes that international
8KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
cooperation in addressing response measures is critical in achieving Paris Agreement goals. The Kingdom is
actively engaged in the following:
i. Socio-economic research studies to assess the impacts of mitigation policy measures implemented
outside Saudi Arabia on the Saudi economy, including data and modelling tools.
ii. Research and development of technologies that enhance economic competitiveness.
iii. Technology cooperation based on the approaches outlined in paragraphs 24-29 in decision 5/CP.7 will
allow for the identification of appropriate technological options, which are consistent with national
priorities, and domestic human and financial resources to promote enabling environment for economic
diversification and technological development (e.g., carbon capture utilization and storage).
iv. Research into understanding the long-term impacts of response measures on energy market stability
and to develop measures that can sustain a stable energy market in the long run.
7. NDC TIMEFRAME
The ambitions outlined in this NDC applies to the period from 2020 to 2030.
8. MEANS OF IMPLEMENTATION
To deliver the ambitions set out in this NDC, the Kingdom will use the following key means of implementation:
initiatives and national programs; finance; technology; voluntary cooperation, approaches and mechanism
under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement; and capacity building.
8.1 INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS
8.1.1 Saudi Green Initiative
Launched in 2021, the Saudi Green Initiative contributes towards achieving the climate ambitions of the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As a national initiative, it aims at improving the quality of life and protecting future
generations. With its ambitious plans and goals, the Saudi Green Initiative is a leap forward within the Kingdom’s
ambition to become a global leader in forging a greener future. To support its ambitions, the initiative will draw
on the expertise and resources of multiple Saudi government entities and private sector partners.
8.1.2 Circular Carbon Economy Approach
The Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) approach consist of the “4Rs” model of reduce, reuse, recycle, and remove
to manage GHG emissions:
▪ Reduce: reduce emissions through sustainable consumption, enhanced efficiencies, including fuel
efficiencies, cleaner energy systems, electrification and renewables, and improving energy and process
efficiencies
▪ Reuse: reusing emissions without changing its chemistry
▪ Recycle: recycling emissions or products containing GHGs into similar or different products with
different chemical characteristics
9KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
▪ Remove: removing emissions from the system, partially (if it will be reused or recycled) or fully (storage)
A combination of the four levers outlined above provides optimum solutions fit for the different contexts in
different countries and sectors capitalizing on their strengths and minimizing costs. CCE can play an analytical,
voluntary, and complementary role in achieving international and domestic climate and development goals,
such as those articulated in nationally determined contributions.
The Kingdom’s CCE approach has its genesis in strategic decision to build a petrochemical industry making use
of waste gases that were being flared as a by-product of oil production in the 1970s. The strategy drastically
reduced GHG emissions, created employment opportunities and helped to diversify the economy. It exemplifies
the Kingdom’s drive to turn “Emissions to Value” (E2V) by using the nation’s vast hydrocarbon resources to
develop a circular carbon economy.
8.2 FINANCE
The implementation of this NDC is not contingent on receiving international financial support.
8.3 TECHNOLOGY
It is the Kingdom’s position that technological innovation and deployment at scale is the key to the Paris
Agreement goals. Furthermore, all technologies must be considered for ambitious global climate change targets
to be achieved in the most sustainable manner. Given their abatement potential, deployment of and
collaboration on the following technologies is crucial: carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), direct-air
capture (DAC), clean hydrogen. In climate adaptation, the following technologies are prioritized: (a) water
saving, recycling, capture, irrigation and sustainable management for agriculture purposes and (b) early warning
system against meteorological extreme events (such as floods, sandstorms and droughts).
The Kingdom has prioritized international technology cooperation and technology transfer at both public and
private sector levels. It plays a leading role at various platforms such as Mission Innovation, Clean Energy
Ministerial, and Global Methane Initiative.
8.4 ARTICLE 6 VOLUNTARY COOPERATION, APPROACHES AND MECHANISM
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers voluntary cooperation and approaches referred to in Article 6.2 as well
as the mechanism referred to in Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement as essential for international climate goals.
Once operationalized, such cooperation, approaches and mechanisms including internationally transferred
mitigation outcomes, will play a role in achieving the Kingdom’s climate change ambitions. They will enhance
private sector engagement, advance innovation in business models, unlock investment flows and support
cleaner energy technology development. Therefore, the Kingdom reaffirms its support for the completion of
rules required for Article 6 operationalization.
10KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA / UPDATED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION / 2021
8.5 CAPACITY BUILDING
The human capability ecosystem in Saudi Arabia has undergone many successful transformational changes to
support the Vision 2030 ambitions. The Human Capability Development Program officially launched in 2021 was
created to develop citizens' capabilities to participate effectively in the ongoing local economic, social, and
cultural developments. As the country still investing in enhancing the basic skills, more highly specialized
capabilities are required to navigate through climate change challenges. The ambitions set out in this NDC
require sustained capacity-building efforts and upgrading of skills at the individual and systemic levels to support
their implementation.
9. MONITORING AND REPORTING ON NDC IMPLEMENTATION
A national monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system is a key success factor for contribution to
economic diversification and adaptation measures with mitigation co-benefits. Established and managed by the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Designated National Authority, the national MRV system is an integral part of the
existing and future monitoring and reporting structures. It provided input into the NDC development and
ambition. The MRV system tracks the progress towards achieving NDC projects and plans and any modifications
thereof.
10. AMBITION AND FAIRNESS
As a developing country with limited sources economy and historically low GHG emission contribution, the
Kingdom considers its 2030 ambition as fair, given that the sum of the contributions leads to a significant
deviation from a business-as-usual scenario emission.
The Kingdom aims at reducing, avoiding, and removing GHG emissions by 278 million tons of CO eq annually by
2
2030 - a more than two-fold increase versus the previous ambition as outlined in the Kingdom’s INDC (130
million tons of CO eq). Thus, ambition represents progression and the highest possible ambition. Furthermore,
2
by supporting mitigation efforts in other countries (e.g., Middle East Green Initiative), Saudi Arabia’s efforts
extend beyond its borders.

of the Republic of Serbia for the 2021–2030 period
Background
The Republic of Serbia has been Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
since 2001 and to the Paris Agreement since 2017. In 2015, the Government of the Republic of Serbia submitted its
Intended National Determined Contributions (INDCs), defining a 9.8% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030
compared to base year emissions (1990). The first NDC also refers to losses and damages associated with extreme
weather events and indicates the need to adapt to climate change.
The Republic of Serbia hereby communicates its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), in accordance
with the Articles 3 and 4 of the Paris Agreement and paragraphs 22 and 24 of Decision 1 CP/21:
Increasing its ambition to the GHG emission reduction by 13.2% compared to 2010 level (i.e. 33,3% compared
to 1990) by 2030, and
Taking into account that in the period 2015-2020 period, Serbia suffered damages estimated at EUR 1.8 billion,
additional to EUR 5 billion in the period 2000-2015, caused by climate change and extreme weather events.
The Republic of Serbia has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the European Union in 2012. This
Agreement entered into force in September 2013. Thus, the country has committed to aligning its legislation on climate
change to the EU acquis that will significantly contribute to the greenhouse gas emission reduction. Serbia is a
landlocked country. Energy is one of the largest sectors of the Serbian economy, and the most of the electricity is
produced in thermoelectric power plants (about 70%) using domestic low-calorific lignite, while the rest comes mainly
from hydropower. Electricity consumption is very high, mostly due to the use of electricity for heating and a very low
level of energy efficiency.
The mean annual temperature increased in the period 2008-2017 relative to the 1961-1990 reference period by 1.5°C,
while in the western and eastern parts of the country, the increase exceeded 2°C. Such trend will continue up to 2-
4.3°C until the end of the century. The annual precipitation increased by 10%, and in the southern part of the country
up to 20% relative to the reference period15 The change in the mean annual precipitation will not be as pronounced as
in the case of temperature change, but will be characterized by interannual precipitation redistribution, while during the
summer season, the deficit of rainfall will be strongest.
The vulnerability of water resources, agriculture, forestry, including biodiversity and health has already been confirmed,
while experience in the last few decades shows negative effects of climate change to energy, infrastructure, transport
and Serbian economy in a whole. In addition, COVID-19 pandemic impacts social aspects of Serbian society, implying
job loss for 34,700 women and a net increase of 1,500 more jobs for men in the second quarter of 2020.1.

water and nutrient supply, therefore, reducing GHG emissions.
Increased agricultural biomass production can partly be used (crop
residues, waste) for renewable energy production, replacing the use of
fossil fuels5. Nutrient management’s mitigation potential was assessed
to 1.09 Mt CO equ./yr. Optimal grazing management and grazing

round tables with active participation of representative of government
institutions, public and private companies, NGOs and scientific and
research institutions were held.
The NDC planning and revision took into account obligations resulting
from the EU accession process as well as national circumstances and
capacities.
Following the international and certain provisions of the EU legislation,
involvement of the broad range of stakeholders was ensured through

The economic, environmental and social impacts of the Mitigation
Actions were considered in the NDC preparation process.
The NDC preparation process was not possible without international
financial and technical support that contributed to improvement of the
national capacities.
However, there is still a need for financial and capacity building and
raising awareness to ensure the NDC implementation and revision.
(c) Other contextual aspirations Serbia suffered damages caused by climate change and extreme

Agreement
With significant contribution of the agricultural production to total gross
domestic product, the overall national economy of the Republic of
Serbia is sensitive to all factors that affect agriculture. Impacts of
climate change on crop production and livestock production have
impact on food storage and food processing sectors in Serbia.
The effects and impacts of climate change on the water sector will be
reflected in shortage of water, more periods of intense drought and
areas affected by droughts and an increased duration of low-flow
conditions in rivers and resulting low-level water quality.

implementation plans, indigenous peoples, in a Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) is a dedicated unit in the Prime
including, as appropriate: gender-responsive Minister’s Office (PMO) Strategy Group that serves as the
manner; secretariat to the IMCCC.
Singapore’s 2nd NDC was prepared taking into account Singapore’s
national circumstances, challenges and opportunities for mitigation.
Studies and technology roadmaps, developed in collaboration and
consultation with industry stakeholders, academic experts and
technical consultants, served as additional input on the mitigation
potential of key technologies. The Singapore Government also
carried out stakeholder consultations, including with members of
the public, to obtain feedback on Singapore’s ambition and possible
measures to reduce carbon emissions.
5(ii) Contextual matters, a. National Singapore’s national circumstances

appropriate: geography, climate, land area, high population density,
economy, sustainable physical constraints in deploying low-
development and carbon energy, an export-oriented
poverty eradication; economy that is highly dependent on
international trade, and climate
vulnerabilities. Please refer to Section 6
for more details.
b. Best practices and First, in Singapore’s experience, it is

contribution; particular, the IMCCC’s role in closely
coordinating Singapore’s climate change
policies from a whole-of-government
perspective enables us to optimise
Singapore’s climate efforts, including
making trade-offs and harnessing
synergies across sectors and mitigation
measures.
Second, as called for under the UAE
Consensus at COP28, the preparation of
Singapore’s 2nd NDC was informed by
both the outcomes of the first Global
6Stocktake (GST) (see Section 3(c) for
more details), as well as Singapore’s
longer-term plans and needs, including
our long-term low emissions
development strategy (LT-LEDS). Even
as Singapore pursues the medium-term
targets set out in our 1st and 2nd NDCs,
Singapore is working towards its long-
term goal of achieving net-zero emissions
by 2050. We continue to invest in, and
foster international cooperation on, the
development and deployment of potential
key decarbonisation pathways, such as
low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture
utilisation and storage (CCUS). We also
regularly review our policy and
regulatory levers, such as carbon tax and
energy efficiency standards, to ensure
they are aligned with our long-term
ambition.
Last but not least, Singapore prepares its
NDC based on mitigation pathways that
are practicable, consider the needs of
stakeholders, and take into account our
national circumstances as well as
international developments. To this end,
7Singapore engages and consults a wide
range of stakeholders, including industry,
citizens, technical experts, academia, and
civil society, on Singapore’s climate
plans and possible decarbonisation
measures. The Singapore Government
also encourages the co-creation and co-
delivery of solutions, to amplify
awareness and encourage a whole-of-
nation effort to address climate change.

stocktake, in accordance
with Article 4, paragraph 9, Singapore is contributing to the 1st GST’s call to triple global renewable energy capacity and
of the Paris Agreement; double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. We are
also supporting efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems and phase out
inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.
• Singapore was an early mover in switching its energy system from fuel oil to
natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel for power generation. Natural gas made
up around 95% of our fuel generation mix in 2023, compared to around 18% in 2000.
o We do not subsidise the use of fossil fuels and instead tax the use of fossil fuels
(e.g., through petrol duties) to reflect their negative externalities.
o To future-proof our energy system, the Energy Market Authority (EMA)’s latest
emissions standards require new fossil fuel generation units to be at least 30%
hydrogen-ready by volume, with the ability to be retrofitted to become 100%
hydrogen-ready in future. This will enable Singapore to further reduce our power
sector emissions when hydrogen becomes more commercially viable.
• Domestically, Singapore is pushing ahead with maximising solar deployment
despite our dense urban environment and small land area. Since 2020, we have
more than tripled our solar power deployment from 0.43 gigawatt-peak (GWp) to
10around 1.35 GWp3. We are on track to achieve at least 2 GWp by 2030, which would
meet around 3% of Singapore’s total projected electricity needs then.
• Given Singapore’s supply-side constraints for low-carbon energy, improving
energy efficiency is also one of our key mitigation strategies. According to the
International Energy Agency (IEA)4, in 2022, our energy intensity was almost half the
global average, and in the best quartile globally. We continue to push for higher energy
efficiency for our businesses, and households through incentives and regulations, such
as the Resource Efficiency Grant for Emissions and Energy Conservation Act.
• We are also embarking on cross-border electricity trading with our neighbouring
countries to import low-carbon electricity to Singapore, with much of the supply
from newly commissioned renewable energy projects. In 2024, Singapore raised our
target for clean electricity imports from 4 GW to around 6 GW by 2035. This is
expected to meet one-third of Singapore’s electricity needs. To date, we have awarded
Conditional Approvals to 5 projects from Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and
Vietnam, and progressed another 5 projects from Indonesia to Conditional Licences.
If realised, these projects will also form the building blocks of an inter-connected
ASEAN Power Grid.
These projects bring win-win outcomes by matching countries with demand for
renewable energy with those who have significant renewable energy potential.
Channelling investment into countries with renewable energy potential can facilitate
domestic and regional decarbonisation, enhance energy resilience and grid stability for
all parties involved, and support economic growth and job creation in source countries.

11At COP29, Singapore signed the Green Energy Zones and Corridors Pledge and the
Global Energy Storage and Grids Pledge, reaffirming Singapore’s support for regional
energy connectivity and increasing energy storage capacity.
Singapore is also accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power.
• As a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance, Singapore is committed to
phasing out unabated coal in our electricity mix by 20405. We are also helping to
accelerate the early phase-out of coal in our region. In 2023, the Monetary Authority
of Singapore convened the Transition Credits Coalition to explore the use of high
integrity transition credits to finance the early retirement of coal-fired power plants.
Singapore continues to study the feasibility of zero- and low-emission technologies, including
renewables, low-carbon hydrogen production, and abatement and removal technologies such
carbon capture and storage (CCS), particularly in hard-to-abate sectors.
• Singapore is exploring CCS and its potential to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors.
As part of our Sustainable Jurong Island plan, we have set a target of achieving
approximately 2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO abatement for the industry
2
sector through CCS by 2030. Singapore recently appointed a lead consortium (S Hub,
comprising Shell and ExxonMobil) to study the feasibility of developing an end-to-end
CCS project from Singapore. We are also progressively exploring the viability of CCS
for the waste and power sectors.
• We continue to invest in R&D to improve the technoeconomic viability of
hydrogen and CCUS technologies through initiatives like the Low-Carbon Energy
5 Coal currently accounts for less than 1% of our fuel mix for electricity generation
12Research programme. We launched our National Hydrogen Strategy in 2022 to chart
a pathway towards potential adoption of low-carbon hydrogen as an energy source and
feedstock by 2050. The Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise
under the National Research Foundation of Singapore recently launched a new
Decarbonisation Programme to grow Singapore’s capabilities in areas such as
hydrogen utilisation, carbon conversion and utilisation to produce biofuel and low
carbon speciality chemicals, and ammonia-ready fuel cells for power generation. The
National University of Singapore also officially launched its Centre for Hydrogen
Innovations (CHI) in July 2024, with the inauguration of an advanced research facility
as CHI’s flagship innovation hub, to help translate hydrogen technologies to real-world
applications. CHI’s research activities span green hydrogen production, hydrogen
storage, hydrogen carrier systems, and hydrogen utilisation. In 2024, Singapore also
backed the COP29 Hydrogen Declaration, reaffirming our commitment to working
with other countries on low-carbon hydrogen.
o We have ongoing efforts to study and where feasible pilot other emerging
low-carbon solutions, such as ammonia and advanced geothermal systems
for power generation.
o Singapore has not made a decision on whether to deploy nuclear energy.
Nevertheless, Singapore is building our capabilities in nuclear science and
technology to better understand the implications and benefits of advanced
nuclear energy technologies for Singapore. This includes leveraging the
expertise of global leaders in this field. For instance, Singapore signed the 123-
Agreement with the United States in July 2024 to deepen civil nuclear
cooperation. EMA also signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with the
Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation from the United Arab Emirates, and the
13Ministry of Climate and Enterprise of Sweden, in October 2024 and November
2024 respectively. These MOUs aim to facilitate capability building in nuclear
technology and safety.
• Clean energy investments may involve high upfront costs and significant commercial,
technological, and geopolitical risks, which could delay such investments. To help
mitigate such risks, we established the Future Energy Fund (FEF) in 2024, with
an initial injection of $5 billion to provide catalytic funding to improve the
commercial viability of infrastructure investments that help to accelerate the energy
transition. For instance, if Singapore decides to build its first-ever hydrogen terminal,
the FEF may be used to mitigate the associated commercial risks. The FEF focuses on
supporting capital expenditure, and will not be used to subsidise fuel costs and recurrent
expenditures.
Our land transport plans are aligned with the 1st GST’s call to accelerate the reduction of
emissions from road transport on a range of pathways, including through development of
active mobility and public transport infrastructure and rapid deployment of zero-and low-
emission vehicles.
• Singapore continues to invest in making “Walk-Cycle-Ride” (WCR) — comprising
active mobility, and public and shared transport modes – the preferred mode of travel.
To encourage the use of public transport, we are expanding our rail network from about
270 km today to 360 km in the early 2030s, putting 8 in 10 households within a 10-
minute walk from a train station. We are also accelerating the building of active
mobility infrastructure to make cycling and walking more convenient and attractive.
Our cycling path network will be extended from over 600 km today to around 1,300
km by 2030. Our aim is for all journeys to the nearest neighbourhood centre using
14WCR modes of transport to take no more than 20 minutes, and 9 in 10 peak period
WCR journeys to be completed in less than 45 minutes, by 2040.
• We remain committed to phasing out pure internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040
and enabling the adoption of cleaner energy vehicles such as electric vehicles. Since
2020, all new public buses purchased have been cleaner energy buses, including
electric and diesel-hybrid buses.
Last but not least, Singapore is also doing our part to accelerate and substantially reduce non-
carbon-dioxide emissions6, including methane emissions.
• Singapore ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2022, and will phase down the
consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) through the regulation of HFC imports.
To curb HFC emissions from the refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) sector, we
ban appliances using refrigerants which have high Global Warming Potential, and
mandate the recovery and proper treatment of recovered spent refrigerants to prevent
their emission. We also require training and certification of technicians to curb
emissions during RAC servicing works.
• Singapore is not a major emitter of methane. Nevertheless, we have taken steps to
reduce our methane emissions from landfills by incinerating our waste and wastewater
sludge. At COP26, Singapore signed the Global Methane Pledge, signalling our
support for collective efforts to reduce global methane emissions.
6 Non-carbon-dioxide emissions from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector are negligible in comparison with other economic sectors and the size of carbon stocks.

6. How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national
circumstances:
(a) How the Party considers Singapore’s national circumstances make it particularly challenging for us to
that its nationally decarbonise. We are a small, low-lying island state with a total land area of about 735.6 km2.
determined contribution is Our population density is over 8,000 people per km2, one of the highest in the world. This
fair and ambitious in the land-scarce, highly urbanised environment makes it difficult to roll out solar power on a large
light of its national scale. Wind, marine, hydroelectricity and conventional geothermal power are similarly
circumstances; unviable, due to the low wind speeds, narrow tidal range, and a lack of fast-flowing river
systems and near-surface geothermal resources. Large conventional nuclear fission
technologies are also unsuitable for deployment due to the sizeable emergency planning zones
they require. That said, Singapore is closely monitoring the latest advances in nuclear
technology. In short, Singapore is alternative energy-disadvantaged.
Our lack of natural resources and small domestic market mean that Singapore’s
economy is highly dependent on international trade. In 2023, in nominal terms,
Singapore’s external merchandise trade amounted to S$1,206 billion, twice our GDP (S$508
billion). Given that we also depend on global supply chains for most of our food and energy,
we are highly sensitive to disruptions and volatility wrought by geopolitical tensions and the
escalating impact of climate change.
23Despite our scarcity of land and resources – or indeed because of it – Singapore has
always prioritised sustainable development, and balancing economic growth with
environmental stewardship.
• We made bold and early choices that enabled us to reduce emissions and protect
the environment. In the 2000s, we switched from fuel oil to natural gas – the cleanest
form of fossil fuel – for power generation. In 2023, natural gas accounted for about
95% of our fuel mix, compared to 18% in 2000. We price energy at market cost, without
any subsidy, and impose fuel duties and road taxes to price the negative externality of
vehicle usage. Singapore was also the first country to impose a vehicle quota system to
cap vehicle growth, and in 2018 became the only country to set a zero-growth rate for
cars and motorcycles.
• As the urgency of tackling the climate crisis grew clear, we took even stronger
action to reduce emissions. In 2019, we became the first country in Southeast Asia to
implement a carbon pricing scheme. Our carbon tax puts an economy-wide price on
the negative externality of carbon whilst helping to support decarbonisation measures,
thus incentivising the transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2024, we raised the
carbon tax from S$5 per tCO e to S$25 per tCO e. It will be further raised to S$45 per
2 2
tCO e in 2026, with a view to reach S$50 to S$80 per tCO e by 2030, making our
2 2
carbon tax level one of the highest in Asia. Today, around 80% of our total emissions
are covered by carbon tax and fuel excise duties on our transport fuels. 70% of our
emissions is covered by the carbon tax and this coverage is one of the most
comprehensive globally.
24In addition to the carbon tax, individual sectors have set out concrete and ambitious plans in
a whole-of-nation push to decarbonise. For example:
• We have acted decisively to overcome our dearth of alternative energy and
decarbonise our power sector. One important measure we are pushing ahead with is
the import of low-carbon electricity, which if successful can help us reduce emissions
whilst simultaneously catalysing investment in renewable energy in the region. In
2024, we raised our ambition for imported electricity from 4 GW to 6 GW — around
one-third of our energy supply — by 2035. Domestically, we are also maximising the
deployment of solar energy despite the challenges of high urban density and lack of
land. To overcome these constraints, we are exploring innovative deployment sites,
such as reservoirs, solar canopies over open areas like walkways and carparks, and
vertical solar installations on building facades. See Section 3(c) for more details of our
power sector measures.
We continue to monitor, study and pilot nascent technologies that could help us
achieve our long-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. As part of our National
Hydrogen Strategy, Singapore is embarking on a pathfinder project for ammonia power
generation and marine bunkering. If successful, the project will position us as one of
the first in the world to test and deploy a direct ammonia combustion power plant. The
lead developer will be appointed in 2025. We are also in the process of a nation-wide,
non-invasive geophysical study to assess our deep geothermal resource potential,
although its technoeconomic feasibility is uncertain. In the absence of conditions
suitable for deploying conventional renewable energy technologies, Singapore
continues to consider, and invest in, a range of alternative and innovative solutions
for grid decarbonisation.
25• Besides the power sector, industry accounts for a significant proportion of our national
emissions. One notable solution we are exploring to reduce industry emissions is
CCS. Singapore, through a private-public partnership model, is actively exploring
the viability of a cross-border CCS project. As Singapore lacks suitable sites for
large-scale CO sequestration, the success of our CCS efforts will be highly dependent
2
on bilateral cooperation.
• Demand-side measures to reduce energy and resultant emissions form the other
key thrust of our decarbonisation strategy. We adopt a combination of financial
incentives, policies and regulations to encourage steady improvements in energy
efficiency across our industry, buildings and household sectors. Our policies and plans
are regularly reviewed and enhanced to ensure continued progress. For example,
recognising the need to manage energy consumption from data centres, the Infocomm
Media Development Authority published the Green Data Centre Roadmap in 2024.
This Roadmap charts a sustainable pathway for the continued growth of data centres in
Singapore by pushing boundaries on energy efficiency at the hardware and software
levels. For the Buildings sector, we have progressively raised the mandatory
environmental sustainability standards outlined in the Code for Environmental
Sustainability of Buildings, whilst enhancing our Green Mark Scheme to drive industry
best practices. In addition, the Mandatory Energy Improvement Regime, which will
come into effect in 2025, will require the owners of existing energy-intensive buildings
to conduct energy audits and implement energy efficiency measures.
Singapore’s efforts have borne fruit — according to the IEA4, in 2022, our energy
intensity was almost half the global average, and in the best quartile globally.
26Even as Singapore pursues domestic decarbonisation on all fronts, our small and open
economy, coupled with our alternative energy-disadvantaged circumstances, mean that
we cannot succeed without international partnerships. Many of our most ambitious
measures, such as electricity imports and cross-border CCS, are contingent on international
cooperation for success. To this end, Singapore participates actively in global efforts to
advance climate action, and is a strong advocate for regional, bilateral and multilateral
cooperation on decarbonisation. See Section 6(b) below for more details of our contribution
to international efforts. Catalysing investment into low-carbon solutions beyond our borders
is one way in which Singapore can deliver an outsized impact on global emissions reductions.
Our national emissions otherwise account for approximately 0.1% of global emissions.
Although our contribution to global emissions is small, we are disproportionately
affected by climate change as a low-lying island-state. Singapore’s climate vulnerabilities
will require us to pursue comprehensive adaptation efforts to protect our coasts, low-lying
areas and communities (for details of Singapore’s adaptation vulnerabilities and strategies,
see Singapore’s first Adaptation Communications, which was submitted as a component of
its 5th National Communication, Chapter 4 on “Vulnerability and Adaptation Measures”).
These adaptation actions will impose significant fiscal costs on the Singapore Government
and people of Singapore.
(b) Fairness considerations, Given Singapore’s national circumstances, our domestic abatement potential is limited and
including reflecting on our needle-moving decarbonisation pathways are contingent on international cooperation to
equity; succeed. Thus, in addition to pursuing the extent of domestic action we can in areas such as
land transport and energy efficiency, Singapore seeks to leverage its strengths as an effective
convenor and interlocutor, catalysing global decarbonisation through international efforts and
fora. We are committed to working with partners to accelerate decarbonisation and green
growth opportunities in Asia, where much of this progress will take place.
27Singapore has played an active role to support the multilateral framework of
cooperation on climate change under the UNFCCC process, including co-facilitating
Ministerial Consultations on Article 6 at COP26, COP27, and COP29. Outside of the
UNFCCC process, we have also led initiatives to strengthen trust and confidence in carbon
markets, to mobilise greater flows of private investment to unlock additional mitigation
outcomes globally. This includes the establishment of the Climate Action Data Trust (CAD
Trust), in partnership with the World Bank and the International Emissions Trading
Association. CAD Trust syncs up data across carbon crediting registries, and publishes this
data at no cost on its online platform as a public good that enhances transparency in markets.
Singapore is also working with Gold Standard and Verra to develop an Article 6 Crediting
Protocol, to help other Parties under the Paris Agreement more easily participate in Article 6
cooperative approaches. Singapore also collaborates actively with international partners, such
as the UNFCCC, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN Environment
Programme (UNEP), ASEAN and city-networks such as the C40, on sharing of best practices
and experiences on climate change and green growth issues.
Second, Singapore has been providing capacity-building support for fellow developing
countries through the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP). Since the SCP’s
inception in 1992, more than 150,000 officials from over 180 countries, territories, and
intergovernmental organisations have participated in SCP courses. We work with more than
50 local and international partners to organise more than 250 programmes annually under the
SCP. In conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the SCP in 2022, we launched the
Sustainability Action Package (SAP), which aims to support the sustainability and climate
change efforts of fellow developing countries. Under the SAP, we conducted more than 50
courses for more than 1,400 government officials on four key sustainability themes: (a)
adaptation and resilience-building strategies; (b) green project management and financing;
(c) low carbon development; and (d) carbon markets. We have also sponsored medium- to
28longer-term consultancy projects to enhance regional capabilities in sustainability. In May
2024, Singapore launched the “SIDS of Change” technical assistance package, which aims to
better equip Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to achieve a more resilient and prosperous
future and includes customised courses on blue carbon and digitalisation. Singapore also
continues to work actively to foster effective international cooperation on climate action with
international partners, such as the UNFCCC, UNDP, the UNEP, and ASEAN.
Last but not least, Singapore is voluntarily contributing to efforts to mobilise finance to
support other developing countries. At COP28, Singapore announced the Financing Asia’s
Transition Partnership (FAST-P), a blended finance initiative. At COP29, Singapore
announced that it would pledge up to US$500 million as concession capital under FAST-P,
to match dollar-for-dollar, concessional capital from partners including other governments,
multilateral development financial institutions, and philanthropies. This combined pool of
concessional capital will be used to crowd in commercial capital and other sources of finance
to raise up to US$5 billion to support Asia’s green and transition financing needs.

30ANNEX
ACCOMPANYING INFORMATION ON SINGAPORE’S ADAPTATION EFFORTS
To ensure that current and future generations continue to thrive in a low-carbon and resource-constrained future, Singapore
has taken decisive steps to strengthen its climate, resource, and economic resilience. Given the complexity and challenges in
adaptation planning, Singapore has integrated long-term adaptation planning into national policies. This will result in
measures that will entail significant costs for the Singapore Government and people but will support global climate action.
For comprehensive information on Singapore’s adaptation efforts, please refer to Singapore’s first Adaptation
Communication, which was submitted as a component of its 5th National Communication, Chapter 4 on “Vulnerability and
Adaptation Measures”, pursuant to the Paris Agreement, and prepared taking into account Decision 9/CMA.1.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

assessment3, as well as stakeholder input, collected via public consultation4. 
 
The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender 
equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: 
the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

(b) 
Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France 
47,5%, Croatia 16,7%, Italy 43,7%, Cyprus 32%, Latvia 17%,

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows: 
Belgium -320Kt CO2eq, Bulgaria -1163kt CO2eq, Czechia -827kt

(c) 
How the Party’s preparation of its nationally determined 
contribution has 
been informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake, in 
accordance with Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement; 
The EU shall set its climate target in accordance with the European Climate 
Law. To that end, at the latest within 6 months of the first Global Stocktake, 
the Commission shall make a legislative proposal, as appropriate, on a Union-
wide climate target for 2040 based on a detailed impact assessment, as per 
article 4.3 of the European Climate Law REGULATION (EU) 2021/1119 OF 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 
30 June 2021.

(i) 
 
 
 
(ii) 
Each Party with a nationally determined contribution under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that consists of adaptation action 
and/or economic diversification plans resulting in mitigation co-
benefits consistent with Article 4, paragraph 7, of the Paris 
Agreement to submit information on: 
 
How the economic and social consequences of response measures 
have been considered in developing the nationally determined 
contribution; 
 
Specific projects, measures and activities to be implemented 
to contribute to mitigation co-benefits, including information 
on adaptation plans that also yield mitigation co-benefits, 
which may cover, but are not limited to, key sectors, such as 
energy, resources, water resources, coastal resources, human 
settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Agreement; 
This NDC represents a progression of ambition compared to its initial NDC 
for the same timeframe. See 6a

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030.

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%,

 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.

settlements and urban planning, agriculture and forestry; and 
economic diversification actions, which may cover, but are not 
limited to, sectors such as manufacturing and industry, energy 
and mining, transport and communication, construction, 
tourism, real estate, agriculture and fisheries 
Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for:

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

1.1 National Circumstances
Somalia has an estimated population of about 16 million, with 80 percent of the population being
youth, almost 50.14 % being female and remaining being male1. Roughly 60 percent of the
population are nomadic and semi- nomadic pastoralists and 60 percent live in rural areas. The
country is considered among the poorest countries in the world with more than 69% of the
population living below the international poverty line.2
Somalia continues to grapple with a fragile political system, insecurity, high levels of poverty,
climate change-related shocks coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic. The latter resulted in a
GDP reduction by 1.5% in 2020 compared to the 2.9% growth experienced in 2019.3 Overall
economic growth was also hampered by a reduction in Foreign Direct Investment (FD1) due to
the contentious 2021 Federal Government of Somalia elections, livestock export bans by Gulf
nations, shrinking remittances due to COVID 19 impact, and global recession.
The country has little historical or current responsibility for global climate change but suffers
disproportionately from the climate crisis. Climate change-related droughts, intermittent floods
and desert locust infestation results in loss of livestock and agricultural production which account
for more than 70% of GDP while employing millions directly and indirectly. The destruction of local
communities’ main livelihood bases continues to increase the number of internally displaced
persons and resultant humanitarian crises. Furthermore, climate change and variability impacts
and conflicts are interlinked in Somalia and affects the affect the most vulnerable (particularly
women and children) and resource-dependent communities.
Somalia is showing progress with recently found stability albeit multi-faceted challenges in
economic, political and social aspects. Therefore, Somalia’s priority for the next decade is to spur
sustainable economic growth through leveraging its natural resources and enhancing living
standards for its population. The implementation of this NDC is consistent with Somalia’s National
development agenda and reaffirms Somalia’s commitment to playing its role in addressing the
climate change threat in line with the Principles and provisions of the UN Framework Convention
and the Paris Agreement.
It is under these aforementioned National circumstances and in line with Article 4.9 of the Paris
Agreement that Somalia presents its updated NDC to the UNFCCC. The implementation of the
NDC requires cooperation, support and investments from both National stakeholders and
International partners.

11.2 Introduction
Somalia submitted its first NDC in November 2015 and remains committed to achieve the targets
despite its challenges and national circumstances. Sustainable development, peace building and
adaptation to climate change remain the highest priority for Somalia. Consistent with UNFCCC
decisions and guidelines, Somalia has taken steps to prepare and submit this revised NDC to
guide its climate change action agenda for the next almost 10 years and contribute to the global
efforts to combat climate change.
Somalia has remained susceptible to climate change and resultant shocks due to its geographical
setting with over 80% of the country considered Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALS). Much of the
brunt has been felt in the agriculture and livestock sector which together account for more than
70% of livelihood base for majority of the population. Somalia is one of the poorest nations in
Africa with 69% of the population living below the poverty line. Somalia’s current GHG emissions
are relatively low estimated at an estimated 53.70 MtCO2eq, representing less than 0.03 percent
of total global emissions. However, it is expected that the sustained stability and peace will
demand reconstruction and development on a larger scale leading to increased GHG
emissions(estimated to double) under business as usual scenario.
Given the climate change impact on Somalia’s development agenda and the urgent need for
assessing the global effort’s aggregated ambition included the updated NDC’s of all parties to the
Paris Agreement, Somalia is pleased to submit information on its NDC update to the UNFCCC
secretariat for consideration.
2.0 Methodological Approach
Somalia’s updated NDC was prepared through an inclusive, consultative multi-stakeholders
technical and policy dialogues. Broad-based Federal and State level consultative workshops and
engagements involving Government institutions (both Federal and State level), NGOs, CBOs,
private sector, academic, and research institutions were undertaken throughout the process.
UNFCCC decisions and Somalia’s National development policies, strategies and action plans
guided the NDC update preparation process. Priority actions for both adaptation and mitigation
sectors were identified through a review of various climate change and National development
relevant documents/reports and in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.
The Initial National Communication (INC) 2018 and recent technical mitigation analysis for NDC
update were the foundation for the mitigation sector scenario analysis. Studies specific to Somalia
were difficult to find for many mitigation options. The overall potential of each mitigation option
was estimated by reviewing the best available primary and secondary data on the existing
prevalence of the practice or technology, then conducting research or making assumptions about
the amount of deployment that was possible or reasonable. Once this was determined, scenarios
were developed that calculated the emissions impact of the mitigation option and its aggregate
cost at the deployment scale determined to be appropriate with a start date of 2021 and an end
date of 2030.
2It is important to note that in some cases the INC data was found unrealistic by experts
considering in comparison with information from other neighbouring countries in the eastern
Africa and other similar countries (in terms of fragility, economic and population sizes) and similar
growth trajectories. In these cases, other published international reports and data were utilized
and average established. This information is likely to be further updated and verified through the
next GHG inventory report and the ongoing first Biannual Update report project.
The Adaptation component of the NDC was informed by recently conducted study on adaptation
baseline covering key vulnerable sectors of the economy. The priorities builds on the National
Adaptation Plan of Action( 2013), federal sectors plans and priorities as well as Federal member
states priorities informed by the consultation processes for the NDC. The country is will further
refine the adaptation priorities in the ongoing NAP process under the GCF Funded NAP
Readiness Project implemented through the UNDP.
3.0 National Policies and institutional Frameworks
2.1 Policy and legal Frameworks
With recently found stability, Somalia has made progress in the development of policies and
institutional frameworks relevant to climate change, Natural Resource Management and overall
National development. The existence of policies and regulatory frameworks are steps in the right
direction although implementation challenges still exist at both the Federal and State levels.
These Nation policies, plans and strategies have set the foundation for the preparation of
Somalia’s revised NDC.

2.2 Institutional Arrangements
The National Climate Change Policy, 2020 recently approved by Somalia Cabinet provides for
the institutional arrangements for climate change. Some of these institutions are yet to be fully
operationalized. The main entities established by the policy include:
Directorate of Environment and Climate Change(DoECC)- The office situated in the Office of
the Prime Minister has the mandate of formulation of federal level climate policies, coordination
of activities by federal institutions, Federal Member States, local governments, international
partners, and other stakeholders in the climate change. The office also serves as UNFCCC
National Focal point and the National Designated Authority(NDA) for Green Climate Fund.
National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) - The NCCC has the mandate for coordinating
and supervising the implementation of the climate change policy. The NCCC is a multi-
stakeholder, high level policy coordination committee and is responsible for the overall
coordination and supervision of climate change activities in Somalia. It comprises the Prime
Minister (or his designate), DG of the Directorate of Environment & Climate Change, Sectoral
Ministries, Directors of Governmental Agencies, Member States’ Ministers for Environment, the
private sector and civil society organizations.
Cross-Sectoral Committee on Climate Change (CSCC) – The CSCC brings together the
officials from across government working on climate change; for information exchange,
consultation, agreement and support among the spheres of government regarding climate change
and government’s response to climate change. It will be chaired by the DG of the Directorate of
Environment & Climate Change. Representatives could be at DG levels. The primary roles of the
CSCCC are as follows: a) Serve as a cross-sector forum for the exchange of ideas, including the
provision of updates on ongoing and planned climate change initiatives. b) Coordinate and advise
sector-specific and cross-sector implementation of activities, and advise on monitoring and
evaluation outcomes as well as future directions of the NCCP; and c) Address the cross-cutting
and social aspects of climate change.
Key stakeholders in climate change planning and implementation in Somalia recognized by the
policy include: Federal Sectoral Ministries Federal Member State Governments, Civil Society
Organizations and private sector.
4A comprehensive analysis of the state of the country’s climate change institutions during the NDC
updating process revealed structural and systemic weaknesses in the institutional bedrock. This
include lack the necessary capacity to address climate change and its associated challenges,
financial weaknesses, the dearth of appropriate policies and inability to enforce laws. Moreover,
most of the institutions suffer from a considerable deficiency in human, financial, organizational,
and institutional capacity to manage the environment and natural resources and respond to the
specific challenges that climate change brought to Somalia.
4.0 Somalia’s Contribution to addressing climate change
Somalia’s update NDC comprises of both mitigation and adaptation components. Overall, the
country’s priority remains sustainable development and poverty eradication while sustaining
stability and peace and building resilience to climate change impacts. Key principles guiding
Somalia’s NDC process include: Country-driveness, linkages with National development and
peace building efforts, maximizing co-benefits, gender-responsiveness, conflict-sensitive,
participatory, inclusive and transparent, Guided by the best available scientific information
including traditional and Indigenous knowledge and coordination. To achieve effective
implementation of the NDC, Somalia will continue to enhance the relevant policy and institutional
frameworks while taking into consideration critical principles such as National Development plans,
Sustainable development and gender mainstreaming.
4.1 Mitigation contribution
Somalia’s current GHG emissions are relatively low estimated at 53.70 MtCO2eq, representing
less than 0.03 percent of total global emissions. The Agriculture, Forestry, and Land-use sectors
are the major contributors to its emissions. As the country realizes its development aspirations,
pursue stability and prosperity, with a growing population (estimated at 2.8% per annum growth)
and economy with urbanization will mean increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The
emissions under Business as Usual scenario are expected to almost double to over 107.40
MtCO2eq in 2030, with significant emissions expected from AFOLU and energy sectors. Other
sectors with emissions growth include transport and waste. The GHG emissions and projections
will be updated through the ongoing Biannual Update report(BUR) project. The resultant BAU
growth will mean environmental and social conditions, including increased competition over
resources, could intensify vulnerability to climate risks. Transitioning to low emissions, climate-
resilient development will address future risks, thereby improving Somalia’s ability to prosper
under a changing climate while reducing the emissions intensity of a growing economy.
Somalia is thus committed to pursuing a low emission sustainable development pathway. Under
the updated NDC, Somalia has set a target of achieving 30% emissions reductions against the
Business As Usual (BAU) scenario estimate of 107.39 MtCO2eq by 2030. To achieve this target,
Somalia will aim to reduce and avoid its GHG emissions by about 32.40MtCO2eq relative to the
BAU scenario by 2030. The updated contributions are in line with Somalia’s National Planning
processes, strategies and actions in the energy, agriculture, forestry, transport and Waste sectors.
5The country The overall costs of the mitigation actions for the NDC period is estimated at USD
6.96 Billion. The proposed actions and estimated emissions reductions are elaborated below:

reflect introduce policies, programs and technologies that drive the country to
low emissions development pathway. Due to the unique national
circumstances, the implementation of the mitigation target will require
international public and private support including in the form of finance,
investments, technology development & transfer and capacity building
Scope of gases Gases covered in this updated NDC are CO2, CH4 and NO2. Other gases were
included in the not taken into account, considering that their use and associated emissions are
contribution extremely low. Sectors and GHG emissions reported within this document cover
99.9% of national emissions.
Sectors covered The emission reduction focuses on three broad sectors namely (1) AFOLU
sector emissions through sustainable reduction of deforestation, land
degradation, afforestation and reforestation, and national REDD+ strategy (2)
Energy sector (electricity, transport, and household emissions) and (3) Solid
waste disposal on land.
BAU emissions Both the population and economy of Somalia is on the rise and this growth will
projections and have significant implications for future emissions. Following a review of 2015-
assumptions 2028 GDP data and formal population projections, the BAU were developed as
part of the development of this updated NDC. The scenario assumes an
economic growth at 4.9% and the population growth of three percent per year
by 2030. Emissions are expected to increase in the forecasted maximum growth
scenario, with economic growth of 7.5% by 2028. The BAU scenario also
assumes that Somalia could exploit its massive untapped fossil fuels
reserves(particularly oil and gas).
Mitigation co-benefits Mitigation co-benefits associated with adaptation actions will be included. Some
resulting from of the adaptation actions with the greatest mitigation co-benefit potential include
adaptation actions the following: rangeland restoration, sustainable land management,
agroforestry, reafforestation, clean energy investments, infrastructure
development among others
How Somalia Somalia is one of the world’s least developed countries with poverty and conflict
considers its updated situations exacerbated by climate change. The country believes that, although
NDC contribution is its contribution to climate change has always been marginal, global efforts to
fair and ambitious, in reduce GHGs emissions will need to be differentiated based on a Party’s
light of its national ecological footprint, historical responsibility, development capacity,
circumstances technological capacity and population. Based on the country’s national
circumstances, this NDC is fair and ambitious.
Somalia considers its updated NDC contribution is ambitious since it
establishes an overall national vision for low emissions and climate resilient
7development. The revised NDC goes beyond the pervious projects based NDC
target to broad and quantified target for the period. This NDC is informed by
technical mitigation and adaptation analysis and is comprehensive covering all
key mitigation sectors. The country is also committing to establishing robust
monitoring and verification system to support the implementation of the NDC.
Carbon offsets Somalia shall not exclude the role of international market mechanisms to
achieve its conditional 2030 targets, subject to the use of robust systems that
enable real and verified emission reductions. The country expects that some
investments in low-carbon, climate resilient infrastructure and some
development options in its NDC can be funded in whole or in part through credit
transfers /International carbon asset(s).
Methodological The NDC was prepared in a consultative and inclusive manner. The NDC
approach revision process was guided by technical mitigation analysis report. Broad
based national and sub-national stakeholders’ consultative meetings were held
during the process. The consultations brought together government institutions
both national and sub-national levels, civil society organizations, academic and
research institutions, the private sector across the country. National policies,
legislations, strategies, programmes and action plans together with UNFCCC
decisions guided the updating process of the NDC. Priority sectors on both
adaptation and mitigation were identified through a review of various climate
change, social, environmental and economic development benefits and their
feasibility.
Information on the The National GHG emissions may be updated with more country specific
circumstances under information and methodological improvements, including under the first BUR
which the Party may and second National communications
update the values of
the reference
indicators
Quality Control and To ensure the NDC quality compliance, the UNDP Climate Promise Quality
Assurance Assurance Checklist has been applied. In additional national and international
technical experts consulted on an ongoing basis throughout the updating
process. The draft final report has also been subject to a technical peer review
to verify the process and results.
Accounting and A measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) system will be established
verification system and the technical capacity, research and coordination of stakeholders will be
enhanced. The achievement will be tracked on a biennial basis and reported as
part of enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement
Institutional The implementation of the NDC will be undertake by both state and non-state
arrangement and actors in Somalia. Directorate of Environment and Climate Change(DoECC) at
Implementation the Office of the Prime Minister of the Federal republic of Somalia is the main
process institution responsible for promoting implementation and coordination of the
NDC in close collaboration with other ministries and stakeholders at federal and
member states level. Capacity building, development of strategies, supportive
mechanisms, monitoring and public awareness and participation for the NDC
implementation will be undertaken by the DoECC with support from partners.
Monitoring-Evaluation The Federal Government of Somalia, through the DoECC has the full
(M&E) a responsibility to monitor and evaluate through regular stakeholders’ consultative
engagement. This will ensure the effective coordination, resource mobilisation
and implementation of NDC target. Monitoring and evaluation of the Mitigation
8and adaptation actions/projects will be harmonized. Inconsistent data and
systems will be synchronized across sectors of national and subnational
institutions. This would provide a holistic view of the overall status of projects
and outcomes/outputs. Furthermore, updated information and data analysis
through the revised GHG inventory and first Biannual update report will inform
the target.
4.2 Adaptation Contribution
As a highly vulnerable country, adaptation and building resilience to climate change is the
country’s highest priority. Through the adaptation contribution of the NDC, Somalia aims to
enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change
through mainstreaming climate adaptation to into sustainable development.The priority areas for
climate change adaptation in Somalia from 2021 to 2030 are informed by its 2020 adaptation
baseline assessment and based on Somalia's national and sub-national adaptation plans and
policies, including NAPA, which provides a climate change adaptation strategy and a climate
change risk mitigation plan. The country has initiated its NAP process and has starting
implementing a GCF funded NAP readiness project to enhance its capacity, establish legal and
institutional frameworks and further define its medium term and long-term adaptation actions in
priority sectors. The NAP will be the main guiding instrument to implement the country’s
adaptation priorities.
Somalia’s NDC estimates the cost of implementing the adaptation components of the NDC target
at USD 55.5 Billion for the 10 years. This translates to financial resources needed for
implementation of the identified adaptation contributions is about USD 5.55 billion per annum from
2021- 2030. It is important to note some of adaptation actions have mitigation co-benefits. The
table below indicates the proposed adaptation actions and estimated costs:

114.4 Gender Mainstreaming
Somalia remains one of the most unequal countries with the Gender Index standing at 0.776(1 –
complete inequality) placing Somalia at the fourth-highest position globally. Climate Change has
exacerbated gender inequality in Somalia, with women and children affected more by climate
change effects due to lack of access and control of critical resources, biased labor division and
absence from decision making processes from household to the National level. For example,
reports indicate that 70-80% of those in IDPs and refugee camps are women, who are exposed
to gender based violence.4 On the other hand, women and youth can act as agents of change
and play a key role in supporting the transition towards low emissions and climate resilient
development in Somalia. There are critical gender issues across sectors and hence the promotion
of gender equality is critical for effective climate adaptation and mitigation in Somalia. The country
needs to be supported to undertake comprehensive and in-depth gender analysis to inform
gender integration across climate adaptation and mitigation sectors. There is a need to build
capacities of key stakeholders at all levels including decision-makers on mainstreaming gender
in climate actions.
5.0 Means of Implementation for both Adaptation and Mitigation Actions
The estimated cost of implementing Somalia’s NDC is approximately USD 55.5 billion for the
period 2021- 2030. The Federal government of Somalia will strive to mainstream the NDC actions
into the national development planning and budgeting processes. As an LDC country with unique
national circumstances, the Government of Somalia does not have the fiscal capacity to mobilize
financial resources for the implementation of the NDC actions.
The successful implementation of both adaptation and mitigation actions thus, require provisions
of adequate and predictable financial resources, transfer of environmentally sound technologies
and capacity building support. Financial support through multilateral and bilateral channels and
sources will be critical to facilitate transparent and successful implementation of the NDC. The
private sector is already involved in climate mitigation and adaptation interventions in the forestry,
energy, waste, water, transport and disaster risk response among others. There is need for focus
strategic efforts and engagements with private sector in order to leverage the potential of these
entities to support a more resilient and green Somalia.
Similarly, there is a need for enhanced capacity building of various institutions and strengthening
policy and legislative frameworks to support Somalia enhance its adaptive capacities to climate
change. In particular, the country requires support to enhance capacities to access multilateral
and bilateral climate finance sources, address barriers and enhance private sector investments
and establish effective institutional mechanisms to enhance mobilization and effective utilization
of climate finance. The country will require support to establish national MRV system and
strengthen its institutional set-up with adequate infrastructure and human resources to track
climate actions.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

The content of the EU NDC has been based on an extensive impact 
assessment3, as well as stakeholder input, collected via public consultation4. 
 
The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender 
equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: 
the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

attacks. 
 
All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

Specific information applicable to Parties, including regional economic 
integration organizations and their member States, that have reached an 
agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

Netherlands 48%, Austria 48%, Poland 17,7%, Portugal 28,7%, 
Romania 12,7%, Slovenia 27%, Slovakia 22,7%, Finland 50%, Sweden 
50%. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.  
 
 
16 
 
 
 The target for 2030 for each MS is an increase in net removals 
compared to data from 2016 to 2018 reported in 2032, as follows:

Not applicable. 
5 
Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
SUBMISSION BY SPAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES 
Madrid, 16 October 2023 
Subject: 
The update of the nationally determined contribution of the European Union and 
its Member States 
 
This submission consists of three parts: 1) overview, 2) the EU’s updated Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) and 3) the Information provided to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and 
Understanding (ICTU) of the NDC. 
 
I. 
OVERVIEW  
Summary of procedural developments 
1. 
The European Union and its Member States submitted their intended nationally 
determined contribution (INDC) on 6 March 2015, together with an annex 
containing quantifiable and qualitative information on the INDC, in line with 
decisions taken at the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Lima. 
2. 
The EU’s INDC became its NDC when the EU ratified the Paris Agreement in 
October 2016, with a target of at least 40% economy-wide reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.  
3. 
In December 2019, the European Council (heads of state or government of the EU 
Member States, the European Council President, and the President of the European 
Commission) endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in 
line with the Paris Agreement. On 5 March 2020, the Council of the European 
Union adopted a long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategy of the 
EU and its Member States, reflecting this climate neutrality objective and 
submitted it to the UNFCCC Secretariat.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
4. 
On the 11 December 2020 the European Council endorsed a new and more 
ambitious EU climate target for 2030 applicable to the EU and its 27 Member 
States of “a net domestic reduction of at least 55% in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030 compared to 1990” and submitted it to the UNFCCC 
Secretariat as an updated and enhanced NDC on 18 December 20201.  
5. 
On 30 June 2021, the EU published a Regulation setting out a binding objective of 
climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 at the latest, aiming to achieve 
negative emissions thereafter, and establishing the legal framework for achieving 
climate neutrality, known as the European Climate Law2. The European Climate 
Law confirmed the domestic reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 
55% by 2030 compared to 1990, setting it as a legally binding target. 
6. 
On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the “Fit for 55” set of 
proposals to revise and update EU legislation with the aim of ensuring that EU 
policies are in line with the climate goals set in the European Climate Law.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
7. 
In 2023 the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament formally 
adopted all the essential elements of the legislative framework necessary to 
implement the “Fit for 55”, and the agreed legislation3 has been published in the 
official Journal of the European Union.  
8. 
Details on policies relevant to the implementation of the NDC have been reviewed 
in light of the adoption of the “Fit for 55” legislative framework and the 
respective updates are presented in this Part and Part 3 of this submission (the 
ICTU). 
9. 
According to the Commission´s estimates, the “Fit for 55” legislative framework, when 
fully implemented, could enable the EU and its MS to overachieve the EU´s net 
domestic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions target of at least 55% compared to 
1990 by 2030. 
10. 
With this submission, the EU updates information on its NDC in advance of COP28 
and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to consider relevant technical information 
contained in this submission in the Secretariat’s NDC Synthesis Report.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
The main domestic policies adopted in view of the new climate target agreed in 
December 2020 are summarized in the following paragraphs as well as in Part 3 of this 
document (ICTU). 
11. 
Emissions reduction targets under the EU legislation are covered by the EU 
Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), and 
the regulation on land-use related emissions and removals (LULUCF). Additional 
legislation and policies on CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger 
cars and for new light commercial vehicles, renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, part of the “Fit for 55%” framework also contribute towards the 
achievement of the EU’s climate targets for 2030.  
12. 
The EU ETS, which has been operational since 2005, puts a price on carbon by 
setting a cap on the maximum number of emission allowances for its covered 
sectors. The EU has reviewed and amended its legislation setting a new target to 
reduce emissions from the existing EU ETS sectors and from maritime of 62% 
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. 
13. 
The extension of the EU ETS to maritime emissions will cover CO2, methane and 
nitrous oxide emissions from ships above 5000 gross tonnage and will apply to 50% 
of emissions from voyages starting or ending outside the EU, and all emissions 
from voyages within the EU and emissions from ships within EU ports.  
14. 
With regard to commercial aviation, the EU ETS will continue to apply effective 
carbon pricing for intra-European flights and departing flights to the United 
Kingdom and to Switzerland. In addition, legislation is in place to apply the Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation of the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (CORSIA), as appropriate, to EU-based aircraft 
operators for flights to and from other third countries participating in CORSIA, and 
to apply carbon pricing to emissions from flights involving third countries which do 
not apply CORSIA from the start of 2027. 
 
 
 
 
5 
 
Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
15. 
The revision of the EU ETS Directive also applies a separate carbon pricing 
framework to fuel combustion in road transport and buildings and additional 
sectors (ETS2) and is designed to price emissions from 20274 without free 
allocation and to contribute to 42% emission reductions by 2030 compared to 
2005 in the sectors covered. 
16. 
Under the revised Effort Sharing Regulation, the EU legislation sets enhanced 
individual binding reduction targets for Member States for greenhouse gas emissions 
not covered by the existing EU ETS, namely domestic transport (except aviation), 
buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries with an EU-level greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 2005.  
17. 
In the LULUCF sector, the EU adopted a Union net greenhouse gas removals 
target of 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, as a sum of the reported 
greenhouse gas net emissions and removals in the sector in 2030. Moreover, the new 
legislation now includes all emissions and removals reported for all managed land in 
the Union.  
18. 
With regard to new cars and vans, the EU adopted legislation to reduce 55% of 
CO2 emissions for new cars and 50% for new vans from 2030 until 2034, and 
for 100% CO2 emissions reductions from 2035 for new cars and vans. 
19. 
Ambitious targets for improving energy efficiency and for increasing 
renewables in the EU energy mix have been agreed. In line with the European 
Commission’s plan to make Europe independent from Russian fossil fuels well 
before 2030, (RePowerEU), the EU has agreed to increase ambition on energy 
savings through an enhanced target to reduce final energy consumption at EU 
level by 11.7% in 2030 and a new target for increasing renewable energy in final 
energy consumption of at least 42.5% by 2030, with an additional 2.5% indicative 
top up that would allow to reach 45%. 
 
4 
In case of exceptionally high prices of gas and oil in the months prior to the foreseen 
beginning of the ETS2, this system will begin operating from 2028. However, the ambition in 
terms of GHG reductions remains unchanged.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
Additional elements related to the EU’s overall efforts on climate action 
20. 
Sustainable transport fuels can play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions. In March and April 2023 respectively, the Council of the European Union 
and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the FuelEU maritime and 
the RefuelEU aviation proposals to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels by 
aircraft and ships and reduce their environmental footprint. 
21. 
A regulation on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure to ensure that 
the public has access to a sufficient infrastructure network for recharging or 
refuelling road vehicles or ships with alternative fuels has been adopted by the 
European Parliament and the Council of the European Union and it will soon enter 
into force. The proposed regulation will play an important role in speeding up the 
deployment of this infrastructure so that the adoption of zero- and low-emission 
vehicles and ships will not be impeded, initiating a virtuous circle, and enabling the 
transport sector to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. 
22. 
In the context of the European Green Deal, EU leaders endorsed in July 2020 that an 
overall climate target of 30% would apply to the total amount of expenditure 
from the EU Budget and additional recovery instruments with a view to comply 
with the objective of EU climate neutrality by 2050 and contribute to achieving the 
Union's new 2030 climate target. They confirmed that as a general principle, all EU 
expenditure should be consistent with Paris Agreement objectives. With this and 
other measures such as the EU ETS, and additional financial market policies, e.g. the 
EU Sustainable Finance Framework, the EU supports the implementation of 
Article 2.1.(c) to make finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission 
and climate resilient development pathway.

Update of the 
NDC of the European Union and its Member States 
23. 
In order to contribute to the transition towards a climate-neutral economy in a fair 
way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social Climate Fund to support 
vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users in coping with the 
price impacts of the new emissions trading system for the buildings and road 
transport and fuels for additional sectors. In principle a maximum amount of 
EUR 65 billion should be made available for the period 2026-2032 in line with the 
articles set out in its Regulation5. 
24. 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation Fund to 
contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-income Member 
States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments to modernise the energy 
systems and improve energy efficiency in energy storage, generation and use of 
renewable sources and modernisation of energy networks, including pipelines, grids 
and district heating, promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions. The 
Modernisation Fund is funded from revenues from the auctioning of 2% of the total 
allowances for 2021-30 under the EU ETS and additional allowances transferred by 
beneficiary Member States – 5 opted to do so. An additional 2.5% of the total 
quantity of allowances between 2024 and 2030 will also be auctioned for the 
Modernisation fund.  
25. 
In addition, the EU ETS’s Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding 
programmes for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies. The 
Innovation Fund, funded 100% by the EU ETS, will provide around EUR 38 billion 
of support from 2020 to 2030 (calculated at EUR 75 / tCO2), depending on the 
carbon price, for the commercial demonstration of innovative low-carbon 
technologies, aiming to bring to the market industrial solutions to decarbonise 
Europe and support its transition to climate neutrality.

26. 
A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will put a price on the carbon 
content of imports of a targeted selection of products. The primary objective of 
CBAM is to prevent carbon leakage and increases in emissions in third countries by 
ensuring certain imported products bear the same carbon price as EU domestic 
producers. It will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner consistent with 
international trade rules, and its application will provide the basis for deeper 
international cooperation.  
27. 
The EU is committed to promoting a human rights-based and gender-responsive 
approach to climate action, promoting social justice, fairness and inclusiveness in 
the global transition towards climate neutrality, full, equal and meaningful 
participation and engagement of women in climate-related decision-making and 
fully meeting our human rights obligations when taking action to address climate 
change. 
II. 
UPDATE OF THE EU AND ITS MEMBER STATES NATIONALLY 
DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (NDC) 
28. 
The EU and its Member States, acting jointly, are committed to a legally binding 
target of a domestic6 reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% 
compared to 1990 by 2030. 
29. 
This document replaces7 the 17 December 2020 submission of the EU and its 
Member States contained in the UNFCCC NDC registry and will, as of the date of 
the receipt of this submission by the Secretariat, be considered the current NDC 
maintained by the EU and its Member States under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

manner; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The content of the EU NDC has been based on an extensive impact 
assessment3, as well as stakeholder input, collected via public consultation4. 
 
The EU NDC is prepared in the context of the EU’s commitment to gender 
equality and cross-cutting priorities, as articulated in commitments such as: 
the commitment to create and maximise synergies between the social, 
environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainable development5; 
integrating the dimensions of human rights and gender equality by Member 
States into their national plans, strategies under the EU Energy and Climate 
Governance Regulation6, the European Pact on Gender Equality7; the EU’s 
support for adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples8. The EU aims to achieve gender-balanced participation 
and encourage the full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and 
leadership of women and girls at all levels of climate action and decision-
making. The EU will also continue to support meaningful engagement of 
youth and children in climate change decision-making processes, as well as 
climate education and training, and increase public awareness on climate 
change. The EU welcomes the recognition by the UN Human Rights

All EU legislative acts are subject to a public consultation before adoption 
by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The 
governance arrangements are set out in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 on the 
Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action and the Regulation 
(EU) 2021/1119 on European Climate Law. This includes an enhanced 
governance system related to integrated planning, reporting and monitoring 
in climate and energy policy fields, including with respect to climate and 
energy targets, policies, measures and projections, inventories and 
provisions for multi-level public participation as well as public 
consultations to be held by Member States in the preparation of the 
integrated national energy and climate plans that implement their policy 
targets up to 2030. These legal acts include review clauses in line with the 
five-year cycle of increasing ambitious climate action under the Paris 
Agreement.  
 
The EU additionally is implementing measures to support the 
implementation of Art. 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement, these include among 
others the EU ETS, or the EU Sustainable Finance Framework, including 
on financial market policy and is continuing to work on further making 
finance flows consistent with a low greenhouse gas emission and climate 
resilient development pathway

agreement to act jointly under Article 4, paragraph 2, of the Paris 
Agreement, including the Parties that agreed to act jointly and the 
terms of the agreement, in accordance with Article 4, paragraphs 16–18, of 
the Paris Agreement 
The EU and its Member States hereby notify the UNFCCC Secretariat of 
the intention to act jointly under Article 4.2 of the Paris Agreement under 
the legislation set out in section 3(a) above, which describe how the EU 
and its Member States shall be responsible for achieving this NDC. 
 
The respective emissions reductions are as follows. 
 
Under Directive (EU) 2023/959 the EU Emissions Trading System: EU 
will reduce its emissions from the sectors covered by this legislation by 
62% from 2005 levels by 2030. 
 
Regulation (EU) 2023/857 sets an EU-level greenhouse gas emission 
reduction target of 40% by 2030, compared to 2005, for the sectors that it 
covers. Each EU Member State will reduce its emissions from 2005 
levels by 2030 in accordance with the following percentage: Belgium 
47%, Bulgaria 10%, Czechia 26%, Denmark 50%, Germany 50%, 
Estonia 24%, Ireland 42%, Greece 22.7%, Spain 37.7%, France

 
Regulation (EU) 2023/839 (which amends Regulation (EU) 218/841) sets a 
Union binding target of net removals in the LULUCF sector. The 
geographical scope of the target is now the complete area covered by 
managed land in the Union. Each Member State has a binding national 
target for 2030 for the increase of net greenhouse gas removals, which 
together will deliver the collective EU target of 310 Mt CO2 net 
removals.  
 
In addition, each Member State commits to achieving a sum of net 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the period from 2026 to 
2029.

Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and, as appropriate, removals: 
(a) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and 
removals corresponding to the Party’s nationally determined 
contribution, consistent with decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 31, 
and accounting guidance adopted by the CMA; 
The EU’s current approach to accounting is in accordance with 
methodologies and common metrics assessed by the IPCC (see 5(d), 
below). At the latest by 31 December 2024, the approach will be in 
accordance with the accounting guidance for NDCs contained in Annex II 
of decision 4/CMA.1. 
(b) 
Assumptions and methodological approaches used for accounting 
for the implementation of policies and measures or strategies in the 
nationally determined contribution; 
Not applicable. EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide reduction in 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
18 
 
 
(c) 
If applicable, information on how the Party will take into account 
existing methods and guidance under the Convention to account for 
anthropogenic emissions and removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as appropriate; 
See 5 (d), below. 
(d) 
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for estimating anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals; 
Methodologies: IPCC Guidelines 2006.  
Metrics: Global Warming Potential on a 100 timescale in accordance 
with IPCC’s 5th Assessment Report. 
(e) 
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and 
approaches consistent with IPCC guidance, as appropriate, 
including, as applicable: 
The EU’s LULUCF policy framework builds on IPCC guidance, TACCC 
principles  and existing accounting rules, updating and improving them for 
the period from 2021 to 2030. The policy framework, from 2026, applies 
net reported emissions and removals, contributing to the aim of enhancing 
the EU’s net land sinks in the long-term. 
(i) 
Approach to addressing emissions and subsequent removals from 
natural disturbances on managed lands; 
Member States may, in the period 2021 to 2025, use a provision for natural 
disturbances on afforested land and managed forest land as set out in 
Art 10 and Annex VI of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 this provision is no longer applied.  
(ii) 
Approach used to account for emissions and removals from harvested 
wood products; 
The EU uses the Production Approach as defined in IPCC Guidelines; see 
also Art 9 and Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/841 (amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). The revised regulation 2023/839 provides for the 
active review of innovative carbon storage products. 
(iii) 
Approach used to address the effects of age-class structure in forests; 
Up to 2025, projected reference levels for Managed Forest Land (Forest 
Land remaining Forest Land) take into consideration age-class structure of 
forest so that changes in management practices are accounted; see also 
Art 8 and Annex IV of Regulation (EU) 2018/841(amended by 
Regulation 2023/839). From 2026 onwards, reference levels are no longer 
applied. 
 
19 
 
(f)  
Other assumptions and methodological approaches used for 
understanding the nationally determined contribution and, if 
applicable, estimating corresponding emissions and removals, 
including: 
 
(i) 
How the reference indicators, baseline(s) and/or reference level(s), 
including, where applicable, sector-, category- or activity-specific 
reference levels, are constructed, including, for example, key 
parameters, assumptions, definitions, methodologies, data sources 
and models used; 
The EU’s approach has been developed in accordance with IPCC 2006 
guidelines for GHG inventories; consistent with decision 18/CMA.1. CMA 
decision (5/CMA.3) also allows Parties to use the 2019 IPCC refinement on 
a voluntary basis. Some MS started using the refinement, which is also 
reflected in the EU inventory. The target is accounted against the net GHG 
removals (emissions) occurring on the territories of Member States for: 
LULUCF Categories: Emissions and removals occurring on reported 
categories of forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, settlements, other 
land, harvested wood products, other, atmospheric deposition and nitrogen 
leaching and run-off, including land use change between these categories.  
LULUCF Pools: Living biomass; Litter; Deadwood; Soil organic carbon in 
mineral soils; Soil organic carbon in organic soils ; Harvested wood 
products 
LULUCF Gases: CO2, CH4, N2O 
 
(ii) 
For Parties with nationally determined contributions that contain 
non-greenhouse-gas components, information on assumptions and 
methodological approaches used in relation to those components, as 
applicable; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC is an absolute, economy-wide greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction target. 
(iii) 
For climate forcers included in nationally determined 
contributions not covered by IPCC guidelines, information on 
how the climate forcers are estimated; 
Not applicable. The EU NDC includes only forcers covered by IPCC 
guidelines (see Section 3 b). 
(iv) 
Further technical information, as necessary; 
Not applicable. 
 
20 
 
(g) 
The intention to use voluntary cooperation under Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement, if applicable. 
The EU’s at least 55% net reduction target by 2030 is to be achieved 
through domestic measures only, without contribution from international 
credits. 
 
Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have been participating in the EU ETS 
since 2008, and an agreement linking the EU and Swiss emissions trading 
systems entered into force in 2020. The EU is continuing to explore the 
possibilities to link the EU ETS with other robust emissions trading 
systems. 
 
The EU will account for its cooperation through the EU ETS with these 
and any other Parties in a manner consistent with the guidance adopted by 
CMA1 and any further guidance agreed by the CMA.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances: 
(a) 
How the Party considers that its nationally determined 
contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its 
national circumstances; 
The EU’s NDC is both ambitious and fair as it will set one of the world’s 
largest fossil fuel-dependent and industrialized economies, on a pathway to 
climate neutrality by 2050, while taking into account fairness and solidarity 
across Member States with diverse national circumstances.  
 
The NDC reflects the EU’s 2030 target, made binding by the European 
Climate Law that also commits the EU to be climate neutral by 2050. The 
2030 target will be delivered collectively by the EU, in the most cost-
effective manner possible, through the “Fit for 55” package of legislation. 
All EU Member States will participate in this effort in a way that takes 
account of Member States’ different starting points and specific national 
circumstances and emission reduction potential, including those of island 
Member States and islands, as well as their efforts made to date. 
 
The European Climate Law creates a system for monitoring progress and 
provides a legal basis for taking further action if needed. It provides 
predictability for investors and other economic actors and ensures that the 
transition to climate neutrality is irreversible.  
 
 
21 
 
 
The EU has a long track record of delivering on its climate policies. Its total 
GHG emissions (excluding LULUCF and international aviation) decreased 
by 1939 million tonnes CO2 eq. since 1990 (or 34,3%) reaching its lowest 
level during this period in 2020 (3708 million tonnes CO2 eq.). The EU has 
progressively decoupled its gross domestic product (GDP) from its GHG 
emissions compared to 1990, with an increase in GDP by 54% alongside a 
decrease in emissions of about 34% over the same period. 
 
In order to ensure that the transition towards a climate-neutral economy 
happens in a fair way, leaving no one behind the EU established a Social 
Climate Fund to support vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and 
transport users in coping with the price impacts of the new emissions 
trading system for the buildings and road transport and fuels for additional 
sectors. The Fund should be exceptionally and temporarily directly financed 
by the revenue of allowances from the ETS. 
 
The EU ETS revision also strengthens the EU ETS-funded Modernisation 
Fund to contribute to the significant investment needs of the 13 lower-
income Member States, as of 2024. It includes support for investments in 
energy storage, generation and use of renewable sources and modernisation 
of energy networks, including pipelines, grids and district heating, 
promoting a just transition in carbon dependent regions.  
(b) 
Fairness considerations, including reflecting on equity; 
According to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report, global greenhouse gas 
emissions need to fall by about 43% below 2019 levels by 2030 to be on 
track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The EU’s “at least -55%” target is 
consistent with this level of reduction, building on the substantial emissions 
reductions achieved by the EU since the base year 1990. 
 
The most ambitious IPCC scenarios (consistent with 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot) are similar to those of the 2018 Special Report on 1.5°C 
which informed the EU’s “at least -55%“ target, as well as the EU’s 2050 
 
22 
 
 
climate neutrality objective. Achieving these objectives will mean that EU 
decarbonizes faster than the pace needed for the world as whole in these 
scenarios. For 2050, the EU objective of achieving climate neutrality goes 
beyond the net zero level for CO2 (only) needed at global level around that 
time.  
 
It should also be noted that the EU has already reduced greenhouse 
emissions to 31% below 1990 levels, while emissions have risen by over 
50% worldwide. The EU has substantially exceeded its 2020 targets, even 
without taking the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic into account. During 
that period, the EU and its Member States’ emissions reductions outpaced 
those of any other major developed or developing economy. 
 
On a per capita basis, EU emissions are also among the lowest of any major 
high-income economy and lower than several emerging economies. 
 
The IPCC 6th Assessment Report also confirms that a sustained commitment 
to climate action, like the EU’s, has been effective in the regions where it 
has been attempted. It also finds that sustained climate policies have led to 
cost reductions for low emission technologies and multi-year emissions 
reductions (even when measured on a consumption basis), and it found no 
evidence of significant emissions leakage from well-managed carbon pricing 
policies.

Switzerland’s second nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement 2031–2035
Foreword
Switzerland is pleased to submit its second nationally determined contribution 
(NDC) under the Paris Agreement covering the years 2031 to 2035.
Switzerland is particularly affected by climate change, with a current climate 
mean temperature of 2.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
For global warming not to exceed the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, green­
house gas emissions need to be curbed with effective measures. Avoiding 
irreversible changes in many areas of the global atmosphere-biosphere-hydro­
sphere system becomes an increasingly challenging task. Tackling this task is 
essential to preserve the greatest possible scope for future generations to shape 
their lives in a prosperous way.
Switzerland is convinced that it is only through concerted action that the 
global community will be able to act in time to avoid the worst consequences 
of climate change. Switzerland remains committed to the full implementation 
of the Paris Agreement.
As a Party to the Paris Agreement, Switzerland fulfils its obligation and con­
tributes to global action on climate change. In past years, emissions generated 
in Switzerland have decreased, and Switzerland achieved its 2020 target for 
the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2017, Switzerland 
submitted its first NDC with a mitigation target to halve its emissions by 2030, 
which corresponds to an average reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at 
least 35 percent in the period from 2021 to 2030. Since then, the Swiss popu­
lation has inscribed in law the goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2050.
Now it is time to look ahead. Switzerland’s second NDC marks a milestone 
towards net zero by 2050. This NDC is further aligned with the 1.5 degrees 
Celsius objective and responds to the recommendations of the IPCC. Reducing 
emissions in line with these commitments will require the decarbonisation of the 
economy and the creation of framework conditions that enable a sustainable 
everyday life.

Switzerland’s second nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement 2031–2035
1	 Switzerland’s second NDC  
(2031–2035)
Switzerland’s second NDC
Switzerland is committed to follow the recommendations 
of the IPCC in order to limit global warming to 1.5 de-
grees Celsius. Switzerland’s second NDC is to reduce its 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 65 percent by 2035 
compared to 1990 levels, to be implemented as an emission 
budget covering 2031–2035. Thus, the target corresponds 
to a greenhouse gas budget of 106.8 million tonnes of CO2 
equivalents1, which is equivalent to an average reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 59 percent over the 
period 2031–2035. The methodological approaches under-
lying the Swiss NDC are included in this communication.
Further, Switzerland communicates a net-zero target for 
all greenhouse gas emissions by 20502.

pathway and indicative sectoral emission development to achieve the net 
zero target by 2050, available on the UNFCCC long-term strategies portal:

2	 A pathway to net zero
The Federal Act on Climate Protection Targets, Innovation 
and Strengthening Energy Security (Climate and Innovation 
Act) adopted by popular vote in 2023 defines intermediate 
targets for emission development (compared to 1990 emis-
sion levels) towards net-zero as well as a net-negative path-
way thereafter:
•	 Between 2031 and 2040: minus at least 64 percent  
on average;
•	 	Until 2040: minus at least 75 percent;
•	 	Between 2041 and 2050: minus at least 89 percent  
on average.
Indicative targets per sector as set in the Climate and 
Innovation Act: The reduction targets must be achieved 
by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Switzerland com-
pared to 1990 as follows:
1.  In the building sector:
•	 By 2035: minus 66 percent;
•	 Until 2040: minus 82 percent;
•	 By 2050: minus 100 percent.
2.  In the transport sector (excluding international aviation):
•	 By 2035: minus 41 percent;
•	 Through 2040: minus 57 percent;
•	 Until 2050: minus 100 percent.
3.  In the industry sector:
•	 By 2035: minus 42.5 percent;
•	 Through 2040: minus 50 percent;
•	 Until 2050: minus 90 percent.
4.  In other sectors (agriculture, waste, F-gases)
•	 By 2035: minus 33 percent;

2050 Net-zero target
These sectoral emission reductions targets imply remain-
ing hard-to-abate residual emissions of approximately 13–
14 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents by 2050, that will be 
addressed through carbon capture and storage (CCS) and 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR): approximately four million 
tonnes of CO2 equivalents in the industry sector and three 
million tonnes of CO2 equivalents from waste incineration 
are foreseen to be captured and stored permanently. An-
other five million tonnes of CO2 equivalents originating from 
the agriculture sector and one to two million tonnes of CO2 
from international aviation are foreseen to be balanced by 
negative emissions. All enterprises in Switzerland must 
reach net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest, taking at 
least direct and indirect emissions into account.
Net-negative pathway after 2050
According to the Climate and Innovation Act, after 2050, 
the amount of CO2 captured from the atmosphere and 
stored using CDR must be greater than the remaining 
greenhouse gas emissions.
The Swiss federal and cantonal administrations 
set the example
By 2040, the federal administration must reach at least 
net-zero in its emissions. In addition to direct and indirect 
emissions, emissions generated upstream and downstream 
by third parties are equally taken into account. The cantons 
aim at minimum for a net zero emission objective by 2040 for 
their central administrations, the same goes for enterprises 
affiliated to the Swiss Confederation. The Swiss Confeder-
ation supports them in this role.

Switzerland’s second nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement 2031–2035
3	 National context
Today, Switzerland’s share in global greenhouse gas emis-
sions is around 0.1 percent. In 2022, total greenhouse gas 
emissions of Switzerland (including LULUCF and indirect 
CO2) equated 42.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents. This 
corresponds to emissions of 4.8 tonnes of CO2 equivalents 
per capita, which is below world’s average. Both total emis-
sions and average emissions per capita have reached their 
highest levels in the 1990s and have been falling continu-
ously for several years. 
Since 1990, Switzerland has experienced substantial eco-
nomic and population growth. These two parameters in-
fluence the consumption and production of energy, traffic 
volumes and the number and volumes of heated buildings, 
which strongly impact greenhouse gas emissions in almost 
all sectors. Compared with 1990, by 2022, Switzerland’s 
real gross domestic product (GDP) as a measure of eco-
nomic output had risen by 68 percent, the building space 
that had to be heated for households increased by 53 per-
cent, 54 percent more passenger cars, motorcycles and 
coaches were in circulation on Swiss roads and 31 percent 
more people lived in Switzerland. Greenhouse gas emis-
sions in this period nevertheless decreased slightly: new 
buildings are better insulated than in the past, cars have 
become more fuel efficient, and fossil fuels are increasing-
ly substituted with renewable energy sources.
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the respective reduction over 
the period 1990 to 2022 in greenhouse gas emissions per 
capita by 42.3 percent and in greenhouse gas emissions 
per real gross domestic product by 55.0 percent, indicat-
ing a decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Switzerland’s second nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement 2031–2035
The largest shares of greenhouse gas emissions arise from 
the transport and buildings sector. Agriculture and industry 
also contribute substantial shares to Switzerland’s total 
greenhouse gas emissions, while energy industries are 
less emissions-intensive when compared with many other 
countries.
Climate change has already left many marks 
in Switzerland
The environment, society, and the economy are affected. 
The current climate mean temperature in Switzerland has 
risen by 2.8 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-indus-
trial average of 1871-1900. The year 2024 in particular 
was 3.3 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial 
period.5 In the Alps, glaciers have been retreating at an 
accelerating pace since 1980. Since 1850, glaciers have 
lost over 65 percent of their volume. If the warming con-

tinues, only a fraction of the current glacier cover will be 
left by the end of the 21st century with large impacts on 
the seasonal availability of water for drinking water, ag-
riculture and power generation. Parallel to the retreat of 
glaciers, the permanently frozen subsoil (permafrost) in 
the high mountains also continues to thaw. More frequent 
mountain and rock falls as well as debris slides that can 
endanger transport links, infrastructure and human life 
in the mountains are a result of this. Already today, large 
investments are necessary to secure infrastructures at 
higher elevations. People are not only threatened by nat-
ural disasters caused by climate change, but their health 
is also directly affected. Daily maximum temperatures in 
Switzerland have risen steadily since 1960. Hotter than 
usual summers have already led to higher mortalities.
Early action
Switzerland has long-standing climate policies. Since 
2000 a specific CO2 Act has been established. Switzerland 
had committed itself under the first commitment period of 
the Kyoto Protocol and reached its target to reduce green-
house gas emissions to 92 percent of base year (1990) 
emissions over the period 2008 to 2012, including through 
the use of carbon credits. At the beginning of 2013, the 
second CO2 Act, a revision of the first CO2 Act, entered 
into force, providing the framework of the Swiss climate 
policy under the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol. Switzerland achieved the committed target – i.e. 
a reduction to 84.2 percent of base year (1990) emissions 
over the period 2013 to 2020 – thanks to decisive domestic 
action and the supplemental use of credits from emission 
reductions through projects abroad. Recently, the existing 
legal framework has again been subject to revision in view 
of Switzerland’s commitment under the Paris Agreement 
for the period from 2021 to 2030. Information on Switzer-
land’s policies and measures which will help strengthen the 
implementation of its NDC can be found in Switzerland’s 
Biennial Transparency Reports (BTR).6

Switzerland’s contribution to international 
climate finance and consistency of financial 
flows
Switzerland takes seriously its commitment to provide 
and mobilize financial support, capacity building, and 
technology transfer for climate action in developing 
countries. Switzerland has and will continue to report 
regularly on its provision of financial support to devel-
oping countries, in the context of its Article 9.5 com-
munication4. In past years, Switzerland has assessed 
its fair share towards the USD 100 billion goal to be 
between 450 and 600 million Swiss francs per year. In 
2022, Switzerland’s international climate finance con-
tribution amounted 711 million Swiss francs in total, 
showing our steadfast commitment to effective climate 
finance. Switzerland intends to continue to contribute 
its fair share in the context of the new collective quan-
tified goal.
With the Climate and Innovation Act, Switzerland has 
taken a first legislative step in making financial flows 
consistent with a low-emission and climate resilient 
development pathway. According to the Act, the Con-
federation will ensure that the Swiss financial market 
makes an effective contribution to low-emission and 
climate resilient development. This includes taking 
measures to reduce the climate impact of national and 
international financial flows. The Federal Council may 
conclude agreements with the financial sector aimed 
at making financial flows compatible with climate ob-
jectives.

Emissions in the base year comprise net emissions and removals from 
all sectors (including LULUCF) indirect CO2. A provisional value for 
base year emissions, subject to change due to recalculations of the 
greenhouse gas inventory, is 52.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents 
(based on the National Inventory Report from April 2024). The value for 
the final accounting will be defined in the inventory submission 
covering data up to 2035.
Net emissions from LULUCF will be reported and accounted for on a 
land-based approach. Emissions from international aviation and 
shipping will be reported as a memo item. They are not yet accounted 
towards Switzerland’s emission reduction targets for 2031-2035.

(i)	 Domestic institutional arrangements, 
public participation and engagement 
with local communities and indigenous 
peoples, in a gender-responsive manner
Swiss climate policy is defined through direct democracy. Switzer-
land's multi-year target of at least minus 64 percent average 
reduction compared to 1990 over the period 2031–2040 is set by the 
Climate and Innovation Act, which was subject to a nation-wide 
popular vote. The Act further inscribed the net-zero greenhouse gas 
emission target by 2050. The second NDC 2031–2035 corresponds to 
the Climate and Innovation Act and has been confirmed by the Federal 
Council.
The Climate and Innovation Act is the blueprint for Switzerland's 
long-term climate policy. The law sets the objective of achieving net 
zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, as well as intermediate 
emission reduction targets for 2040, along with an average reduction 
over the period 2031–2040. The law includes indicative values for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the main sectors (building, 
transport and industry). It entered into force on January 1st 2025. 
The Climate and Innovation Act first responded to a popular initiative 
“For a healthy climate (glacier initiative)”, which was submitted in 
2019, with a view to ban the consumption of fossil fuels such as gas 
and oil by 2050. As a compromise, the Swiss Parliament elaborated 
an indirect counter-proposal to this initiative, which incorporated the 
initiative's main objectives. The initiative committee then condition-
ally withdrew the glacier initiative. A referendum was filed against 
the counter-proposal of the Parliament, hence making it subject to a 
nation-wide popular vote. On June 18, 2023, the Swiss population 
voted to accept the counter-proposal, entitled the Climate and 
Innovation Act. Without introducing any bans, the law provides for 
the reduction of oil and gas consumption, as well as the granting of 
financial support to encourage the ecological transition.
The measures for achieving the climate targets defined in the 
Climate and Innovation Act are set out step by step in separate laws. 
These are primarily the CO2 Act, but also the Energy Act and 
agricultural policy. This approach ensures that measures are 
developed and debated in a democratic manner. The participation of 
all those concerned is thus guaranteed, as future legislative changes 
are subject to an optional referendum.
According to the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, the Swiss 
people together with the Cantons are sovereign and ultimately the 
supreme political authority. The most important formal instruments 
of Switzerland’s direct democracy are (i) the optional referendum 
which allows citizens to veto decisions made by the Swiss Parlia-
ment, (ii) the mandatory referendum on each constitutional 
amendment, and (iii) the popular initiative by which citizens can 
propose amendments to the Constitution of the Swiss Confederation.

view that Parties should, when taking action to address climate 
change, respect, promote, and consider their respective human 
rights obligations, including due consideration for gender equality 
and gender responsive policies, intergenerational equity, and the 
needs of particularly vulnerable groups. Switzerland is further 
committed to upholding environmental integrity, including the 
integrity of ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity.

c.
How the Party’s preparation of its 
nationally determined contribution has 
been informed by the outcomes of the 
global stocktake, in accordance with 
Article 4, paragraph 9, of the Paris 
Agreement;
Switzerland is committed to the implementation of the decision on the 
first global stocktake (1/CMA.5). In the first global stocktake, Parties 
recognized the Paris Agreement temperature goals and underscored 
that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the tempera-
ture increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with two degrees Celsius 
and resolved to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 
degrees Celsius. They also recognized that limiting global warming to 
1.5 degrees Celsius with no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and 
sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43 percent 
by 2030 and 60 percent by 2035 relative to the 2019 level and reaching 
net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. They encouraged Parties to 
come forward in their next nationally determined contributions with 
ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets, covering all 
greenhouse gases, sectors and categories and aligned with limiting 
global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as informed by the IPCC, in the 
light of different national circumstances.
Information on how Switzerland’s second NDC supports the recommen-
dations of the IPCC, and specifically on alignment with the 1.5 degrees 
Celsius objective can be found under 7(b). Switzerland is answering the 
call for developed countries to take the lead by undertaking econo-
my-wide absolute emission reduction targets. 
Finally, Switzerland’s second NDC is aligned with its Long-Term 
Strategy and its Supplement8, in accordance with paragraph 40 of the 
decision of the first global stocktake.
Further information on how Switzerland intends to contribute to the 
global calls and objectives defined in the first global stocktake, Decision 
1/CMA.5, can be found in Chapter 6 and in annex to this communication 
as well as in Switzerland’s Biennial Transparency Report.

approaches used for accounting for 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals corresponding to the Party’s 
nationally determined contribution, 
consistent with decision 1/CP.21, 
paragraph 31, and accounting guidance 
adopted by the CMA
The accounting approach is based on the national greenhouse gas 
inventory. By doing so, scope, coverage, data sources, assumptions, 
methodologies, and metrics are fully consistent between Switzerland’s 
NDC and the greenhouse gas emissions inventory. The methodologies 
used ensure transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and 
comparability as far as can be achieved and avoid any double 
counting of emissions and removals, consistent with decisions  
4/CMA.1 and 18/CMA.1.
b.
Assumptions and methodological 
approaches used for accounting for the

If applicable, information on how the Party 
will take into account existing methods 
and guidance under the Convention to 
account for anthropogenic emissions and 
removals, in accordance with Article 4, 
paragraph 14, of the Paris Agreement, as 
appropriate
The national greenhouse gas inventory is relying on metrics agreed 
upon by the CMA and methodologies and good practice guidance 
from the IPCC in order to provide a sound quantitative framework for 
accounting of anthropogenic emissions and removals.
In order to foster environmental integrity and to reduce uncertainty 
due to assumptions regarding extrapolated management practices 
and other parameters influencing the calculation of reference levels, 
Switzerland decided to use net accounting of emissions and 
removals in the LULUCF sector from 2021 onwards.
d.
IPCC methodologies and metrics used for 
estimating anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions and removals
Methodologies: 
(i)   2006 IPCC guidelines, 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC 
guidelines, or any subsequent version or refinement of the IPCC 
guidelines agreed upon by the CMA, as per UNFCCC decisions  
4/CMA.1, paragraph 12.(a) and 18/CMA.1, paragraph 20; 
(ii)  2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance 
Arising from the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC 2014 KP Supplement) by the 
IPCC; 
(iii) 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands (IPCC 2014 Wetlands 
Supplement).
Metrics: 
100-yr GWP values from 5th IPCC assessment report, or from a 
subsequent IPCC assessment report as agreed upon by the CMA, as per 
UNFCCC decision 18/CMA.1 paragraph 37.
e.
Sector-, category- or activity-specific assumptions, methodologies and approaches consistent with IPCC 
guidance, as appropriate, including, as applicable:
(i)	  Approach to addressing emissions and 
subsequent removals from natural 
disturbances on managed lands
No provision for natural disturbances will be applied.
(ii)	 Approach used to account for emissions 
and removals from harvested wood 
products
Harvested wood products are accounted for using a production 
approach (only wood from domestic harvest), consistent with the 2013 
Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising 
from the Kyoto Protocol (IPCC 2014 KP Supplement).
(iii) Approach used to address the effects 
of age-class structure in forests

The intention to use voluntary cooperation 
under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, if 
applicable.
Switzerland will partly use internationally transferred mitigation 
outcomes (ITMOs) from cooperation under Article 6. The share of 
emission reductions realized abroad will decrease for the 2031–2035 
period compared to the pre-2030 period, consistent with the 
principle of progression. The percentage of domestic emission 
reductions will be determined in the context of parliamentary 
deliberations on the CO2 Law for the post-2030 period. Switzerland 
will implement all relevant Article 6 guidance adopted by the 
conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to 
the Paris Agreement (CMA), to apply robust rules that avoid any form 
of double counting, ensure environmental and social integrity and 
promote sustainable development, including the protection of human 
rights.
As of February 2025, Switzerland signed bilateral agreements with 
Peru, Ghana, Senegal, Georgia, Vanuatu, Dominica, Thailand, 
Ukraine, Morocco, Malawi, Uruguay, Chile, and Tunisia, creating the 
necessary frameworks for cooperative approaches under Article 6.2 
of the Paris Agreement. The agreements govern the transfers of miti-
gation outcomes and their use9. The ITMOs may be used for other 
international mitigation purposes, such as e.g. voluntary climate 
targets by private actors, which would not be counted towards 
Switzerland’s NDC.

Switzerland’s second nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement 2031–2035

How the Party 
considers that 
its nationally 
determined 
contribution is 
fair and 
ambitious in the 
light of its 
national 
circumstances
a.
b.
How the Party considers that its nationally 
determined contribution is fair and 
ambitious in the light of its national 
circumstances
Fairness considerations, including 
reflecting on equity
It is important to Switzerland that the global community shares the 
required efforts to combat global climate change in a fair and 
equitable manner and must be rooted in the best available science.
It is in the interest of all Parties to come forward with their highest 
possible ambition. It is important to recognize that equity and 
fairness considerations are multifaceted, and that not one principle 
alone can adequately capture equity considerations. The evolving 
nature of a country’s circumstances should also be reflected in 
fairness considerations.
Switzerland’s understanding of a fair share includes in particular 
consideration of the aspects below.
•	Equity should take into account responsibility for cumulative 
emissions, rooted in countries past, present, and future emissions. 
Total emissions, territorial and consumption-based, as well as per 
capita emissions are to be considered. Based on the polluter pays 
principle, countries who bear responsibility for emissions in the past 
and those who are responsible for a large proportion of emissions 
now, as well as those whose emissions are still rising, should 
demonstrate leadership and strive to put in place urgent emission 
reductions that support a 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway.
•	Switzerland has a low level of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions 
since 1990, contributing around 0.12 percent of cumulative global 
greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2021. Today, Switzerland emits 
around 0.08 percent of world’s greenhouse gas emissions and per 
capita emissions are below world’s average. Through climate policies 
implemented domestically, Switzerland’s total share in global 
greenhouse gas emissions as well as per capita emissions continue to 
decrease despite a substantial growth in real gross domestic product 
(1990–2022: +68 percent) and population (1990–2022: +31 percent).
•	To respond to the urgency of climate action, equity considerations 
must take into account capacity. Major emitters and those with 
significant economic capacity should make significant contributions 
to climate action. Capacity to contribute to solving the climate 
problem is closely related to the ability to invest in appropriate 
mitigation measures, such as carbon-efficient technologies. Hence, 
one aspect of capacity is to take into account GDP per capita in 
fairness considerations.
•	Finally, international cooperation to build capabilities for low 
carbon and climate-resilient development in all countries is a vital 
part of any serious approach to addressing climate change. 
Switzerland continues to support its partner countries to increase 
their climate action.
Based on equity considerations outlined above, Switzerland is 
committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with emission 
reduction pathways that keep the increase in global average 
temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Switzerland remains open to discuss a framework to transparently 
consider Parties’ equitable contributions to the global effort of 
keeping within the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal.

How the Party has addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 3, of the Paris Agreement
Article 4, paragraph 3 of the Paris Agreement provides that each 
Party’s NDC will present a progression beyond the Party’s first NDC 
and reflect its highest possible ambition.
Switzerland’s second NDC reflects a progression beyond its first 
NDC in several areas: 
Strengthened emission reduction objective (headline objective)
Switzerland’s emission reduction objective of minus at least 65 
percent by 2035 compared to 1990, to be implemented as an 
emission budget of 106.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents covering 
2031–2035, which is equivalent to an average reduction of green-
house gas emissions by at least 59 percent over the period 
2031–2035, is strengthened, compared with its first NDC of at least 
minus 50 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, corresponding to an 
average reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 35 
per cent over the period 2021–2030.
Increased domestic emission reductions
The share of emission reductions realized abroad will decrease for 
the 2031–2035 period compared to the pre-2030 period, consistent 
with the principle of progression. The percentage of domestic 
emission reductions will be determined in the context of parliamen-
tary deliberations on the third CO2 Law.
Strengthened measures and legislative framework
Switzerland’s second NDC further presents an enhanced policy and 
legislative framework, including new and strengthened measures, 
intermediate and sectoral targets, as well as a long-term net-zero 
target 2050 and a net-negative pathway defined in domestic law. 
Strengthened accounting and baseline methodology
Switzerland’s second NDC includes a carbon budget, which provides 
new quantitative precision towards quantification of future emis-
sions.
Switzerland will account for changes in net emissions and removals 
in the LULUCF sector, using a land-based approach, covering all 
land-uses. By doing so, the uncertainties related to the calculation 
of reference levels are avoided and a more robust accounting is 
achieved.
Inclusion of new sectors towards 2050
According to the Climate and Innovation Act, international aviation 
and maritime navigation will contribute to the achievement of the net 
zero objective by 2050. These emissions are not yet accounted 
towards Switzerland’s emission reduction targets for 2031-2035. 
d.
How the Party has addressed Article 4, 
paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement
Article 4, paragraph 4 of the Paris Agreement provides for developed 
countries, such as Switzerland, to continue taking the lead by undertak-
ing economy-wide emission reduction targets. Switzerland has a long 
history of concrete climate policy measures and a CO2 Act since 2000. 
The country had absolute economy-wide emission reduction targets 
both under the first and second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol and continues to formulate absolute economy-wide targets.

Article 2
a.
How the nationally determined contribution 
contributes towards achieving the 
objective of the Convention as set out in 
its Article 2
The Paris Agreement has been adopted in the context of the 
UNFCCC and specifies its provisions. Thus any actions and measures 
taken in view of Article 2.1a and 4.1 of the Paris Agreement, as per 
this NDC, serve the objective of the Convention.
b.
How the nationally determined contribution 
contributes towards Article 2, paragraph 
1(a), and Article 4, paragraph 1, of the 
Paris Agreement
Switzerland’s second NDC is consistent with Article 2.1(a) to hold the 
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees 
Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit 
temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial 
levels.
Switzerland’s second NDC keeps Switzerland on an emission 
development pathway in line with the recommendations of the IPCC to 
keep average global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The 
sixth assessment report of the IPCC, published in 2023, confirmed the 
findings of the IPCC special report on global warming of 1.5 degrees 
Celsius published in 2018. It reiterated that global greenhouse gas 
emissions must peak as early as this decade and then decline rapidly 
and substantially. Scenarios in which global warming does not exceed 
1.5 degrees Celsius with a probability of 50 percent achieve net zero 
for CO2 emissions in the early 2050s and net zero for all greenhouse 
gases in the 2070s. In these scenarios, global greenhouse gases 
would have to be reduced by 43 percent by 2030, 60 percent by 2035 
and 84 percent by 2050 compared to 2019 levels. According to the 
IPCC, there is a global CO2 budget of 500 gigatonnes of CO2 from 
2020 onwards. At the same time, there needs to be a significant 
reduction in the other greenhouse gases, particularly methane. In the 
meantime, this budget has decreased further. According to the UNEP 
Emissions Gap Report 2024, from 2025 only 200 gigatonnes of CO2 
will be available to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with a 
probability of 50 percent.
Switzerland’s second NDC puts Switzerland slightly above an 
emission development pathway that responds to the recommenda-
tions of the IPCC to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 
approximately 60 percent from 2019 levels by 2035 (equivalent to 
62.5 percent by 2035 compared to 1990). 
Switzerland’s net zero objective is more ambitious than the IPCC’s 
recommendation to reach net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, 
by incorporating all greenhouse gas emissions, including international 
aviation and shipping. Furthermore, a clear trajectory is established 
towards net-zero by 2050, underpinned by sectoral and intermediate 
targets.

Switzerland’s second nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement 2031–2035
5	 Implementation framework and 
contributions to the global stocktake
The legislative framework
In its national legislation, the international commitment 
translates as follows:
•	 The second revision of the CO2 Act requires an annu-
al reduction of 1.5 percent relative to the 1990 level
during the years 2021–2024. At least 75 percent of the
reduction of emissions must be achieved with domestic
measures, the remainder with measures abroad;
•	 The third revision of the CO2 Act requires a reduction
of total greenhouse gas emissions (relative to 1990)
by	
−at least 50 percent by 2030 and	
−at least 35 percent in the mean over the years
2021–2030, primarily with measures in Switzerland,
but also allowing for measures abroad;
•	 The Climate and Innovation Act requires net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a reduction
of total greenhouse gas emissions (relative to 1990)
by	
−at least 64 percent in the mean over the years
2031–2040,	
−at least 75 percent by 2040, and	
−at least 89 percent in the mean over the years
2041–2050; as far as possible, the targets must be
achieved by reducing emissions in Switzerland;
•	 The Climate and Innovation Act also sets out the following
sectoral targets (reductions relative to 1990):	
−Buildings sector: By at least 82 percent by 2040 and
by 100 percent by 2050;	
−Transport sector (excluding international aviation):
By at least 57 percent by 2040 and by 100 percent
by 2050;	
−Industry sector: By at least 50 percent by 2040 and
90 percent by 2050;
•	 With the ongoing revision of the CO2 Ordinance (to be
adopted in spring 2025), the Swiss Federal Council
aims at establishing – by agreement with the parties
concerned – sectoral targets to be reached by 2030;
•	 The deliberations on the CO2 Act for the post-2030 period
have begun in 2025, and will determine the package of
climate policy measures underpinning the period
2031–2035, covered by this NDC.
Switzerland’s national targets for the reduction of green-
house gas emissions are identical in scope to Switzerland’s 
nationally determined contribution. Further information

Summary
 
This document represents the Syrian Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on a voluntary 
basis, as a national need and contribution to support international efforts to achieve Paris 
agreement goals, in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and strengthen the global 
response to the threat of climate change. It comes based on the commitment of the Syrian Arab 
Republic to environmental conventions, protocols and agreements, including the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
The Syrian Arab Republic, as a developing and non-industrialized country that located in arid to 
semi-arid region, is affected by the impacts of climate changes in its multiple dimensions, it also 
faces exceptional circumstances as a result of the terrorist war launched since 2011, and the 
operations of the illegal ""international coalition"", in which resulted a massive destruction to 
infrastructure and environment, and allocating a large part of the national efforts and available 
resources to address the repercussions of these circumstances. 
The unilateral coercive economic measures imposed by some states and regional entities on the 
Syrian Arab Republic since 2011, have caused enormous losses of economic structures and 
negatively affected the efforts of the Syrian State institutions and civil society for protecting the 
environment and supporting national plans of adaptation and mitigation. The continuation of these 
measures is the biggest challenge that Syrian’s effort faces in accordance with its international 
commitments related to the climate change and environment, and to strengthen the society’s 
resilience since these measures, accompanied by a deliberated reduction of international aid and 
financing, targeted the key sectors of the Syrian economy, particularly technological components, 
energy and financing channels. Not to mention the catastrophic impacts of the continued 
occupation of the Occupied Syrian Golan by Israel, the occupying power, in which depletes its 
resources and pollutes its natural environment. 
 The terrorist war against the Syrian Arab Republic has hindered the implementation of the national 
environmental strategy. Therefore, the transitional period after the war requires a special strategy 
aiming to a new stage of recovery. The main phase of this strategy is to insure a rapid respond to 
restore all affected production and service structures and environmental systems, in addition to 
providing the requirements of linking between local development projects and their contributions 
to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change, especially through the national ownership of 
reconstruction projects and strengthening the legal environment aiming at protecting and investing 
natural and environmental resources, as well as achieving the national response to urgent and long-
term needs, in order to reach the inclusive economic growth period with its environmental 
dimension. 
This report covers the visions and ambitions of the Syrian Arab Republic for addressing the 
impacts of climate change, and the efforts of mitigation and adaptation for the period 2020-2030, 
as well as acknowledging the importance of strengthening the pillars of sustainability as a 
""developmental status"", including the environmental dimension, taking into account the special 
national circumstances and effects of the terrorist war which resulted in major losses in previous 
development achievements.  
3 
 
Thus, the Syrian Arab Republic considers its contributions in line with the principles of the 
UNFCCC, and reaffirms, according to the Paris Agreement, that Developed Country parties shall 
provide support to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in 
order to implementing their contributions and increase resilience, thus pursuing efforts, assess the 
impacts of GHG emissions, plan, and implement the relevant activities within specific periods of 
time. These efforts shall be developed in accordance with the level of progress achieved in the 
targeted sectors. 
  
1. Introduction 
The terrorist war on the Syrian Arab Republic, and the continuation of the unilateral coercive 
economic measures imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic, have caused a massive destruction of a 
number of production structures, a significant decline in economic, social and environmental 
factors, prioritizing issues at the expense of others, lack of access to technology, including 
production technologies, as well as freezing of international funding and support in many fields, 
including funds for the preparation and implementation of the national plans aimed to protect the 
environment. 
However, these circumstances have enhanced the Syrian state's decision regarding the necessity 
of adopting the approach of sustainability as a national priority, especially by restoring the lost 
previous developmental gains, overcoming the impacts of the war and addressing the challenges 
that Syrian society faced with them. These national efforts were implemented through continuing 
of rehabilitating and sustaining physical, service and environmental infrastructure; increasing the 
use of alternative energies; reducing waste generation and increasing recycling; upgrading the 
efficiency of housing by applying the green architecture; rationalizing energy consumption; and 
promoting sustainable transportation; in which all contribute to reduce GHG emissions and support 
mitigating the impacts of climate change. 
Based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  ( CBDR) as stipulated in 
UNFCCC and its related agreements and protocols, the Syrian Arab Republic stresses the need of 
developed countries to meet their responsibilities related to the Climate Change ,especially 
through providing an adequate and predictable finance, capacity building and transfer of 
technology ,to support the national plans of developing countries related to adaptation of the 
impacts of climate change. 
Following of the Syrian Arab Republic’s ratification of Paris Agreement on 13/11/2017, the 
national committee established in the Ministry of Local Administration and Environment, which 
includes representatives of the relevant ministries and national bodies, intensified its work in 
preparing the first NDC. 
The Syrian NDCs prepares on a voluntary basis for the period 2020-2030 and in line with national 
priorities. It has been developed within institutional frameworks through sectorial consultations 
and workshops in the Syrian governorates with participation of national stakeholders and 
representatives of local administration.

2. National Circumstances 
Although the Syrian Arab Republic is not one of the major contributor countries to climate change 
and greenhouse gas emissions, it is one of the countries highly affected by the global warming and 
climate change, especially the unprecedented climatic phenomenon, such as precipitation change 
and rainstorms, drying up of some rivers or dropping water levels of natural and artificial lakes, 
frequent drought and its increasing risks, unprecedented levels of temperatures, heatwaves, forest 
fires, sand and dust storms, increasing duration and frequency of sand and dust storms, and 
desertification. The impact of global climate changes with their local impacts on land-use patterns 
and the accelerating pace of their degradation has put pressure on:  
- 
Natural resources for agriculture and livestock exploitation, and the implications on 
sustainable production and strengthening communities' resilience. 
- 
Renewable energy resources such as hydropower, due to drop in water levels, and 
wind power, as a result of climate variability. 
- 
Water resources, which are already limited, especially the suffering from a growing 
water deficit due to the increasing demand of water for irrigation, drinking and 
industrial purposes. 
- 
Natural ecosystems and their balance, as well as the overall impact on public health 
and other economic, production, service and social sectors. 
In fact, the Syrian Arab Republic faces obstacles to obtain advanced technologies that meet all 
environmental standards in which play a key role in sustaining and strengthening mitigation and 
adaptation measures, and building resilience. It faces also the lack of specialized skills in such 
areas, particularly the expertise in environmental economics and environmental degradation costs. 
In addition, it faces obstacles in the context of implementation the vital projects, including CDM 
projects, as well as localization of many technologies and software in order to monitor the current 
situation and to simulate and extrapolate the future, while these tools are important for developing 
all economic, social and environmental indicators and measuring the level of meeting the needs of 
management and planning of sustainable development. Not to mention, that these obstacles are 
mainly due to the unilateral coercive economic measures imposed on Syrian Arab Republic for 
decades ago, in which increased since 2011, and their serious implications on building an 
economy, which be able to adapt climate change. 
However, these obstacles did not prevent the Syrian state from paying the appropriate attention to 
the environmental dimension, through: 
- 
The new constitution (2012) in which stipulates that: ""Protection of the environment 
shall be the responsibility of the state and society and it shall be the duty of every 
citizen"". 
- 
The Local Planning regulation (107/2011) gives the local units the tasks of achieving 
a balanced and sustainable development.  
5 
 
- 
The Regional Planning Law No. 26 (2010) adopts regional planning approach and 
contributes to support development across regions according to priorities and 
requirement.  
- 
The Environment Law NO 12 (2012) established the rules of protection and 
preservation of environmental elements and its main components. 
The Syrian Arab Republic presented its first national communication on climate change in 2010, 
while the national emission inventory study showed that the total GHG emissions reached 79.07 
TGCO2 eq in 2005. The share of emissions from the energy sector was 73%, followed by 
agriculture sector 18%, industrial sector 4%, and waste sector 5%. The preparing of the second 
national communication began in 2012 and could not be fulfilled as a result of the freezing of 
funding by international donors. This fact highlights the urgent need to resume international 
support in order to enable the Syrian Arab Republic to complete this communication. 
The impacts of the war have prevented the realization of the requirements of linking national 
development projects with their objectives of adaptation and mitigation. The above mentioned 
challenges have been exacerbated by several aspects: 
- 
Terrorist groups attacks to infrastructure of water resources, dams, irrigation networks, 
electricity, oil and gas fields; as well as sabotage or destruction of equipment at the 
stations; poisoning of water resources, including potable water; random extraction of 
crude oil and using primitive ways to transport and refining the stolen petroleum 
products which caused a significant environmental contamination; also cutting and 
burning of forests; degradation of forest vegetation due to vandalism, which has 
adversely affected biodiversity.  
- 
The strikes of the so-called ""international coalition"" on Syrian infrastructure and 
natural resources, using of internationally banned munitions and weapons in its 
operations, as well as the Turkish military aggression, which all have caused massive 
damages and environmental disasters, pollution in agricultural and pastoral lands, 
surface and underground waters, and the proliferation of fumes containing harmful 
and carcinogenic substances. Thus, these strikes have negative impacts on public 
health and threaten the life cycle of animals and plants. 
The Syrian Arab Republic looks forward to restore and support the pillars of sustainability on the 
local level ,by rehabilitating all production and service systems in their environmental 
dimensions within institutional and governance framework. The achievement of national 
contributions and their successive phases depends on the international commitment in providing 
the adequate and predictable financial support, as well as enhancing the transfer of technology 
and capacity building of national institutions.

3. Mitigation Measures 
Despite the difficult conditions in Syrian Arab Republic, a number of projects, policies and 
strategies that contribute to reducing emissions in many sectors, have been developed through 
the following intervention sectors: 
 
1. Energy sector 
The Syrian energy sector, in which oil and gas are the main sources of it, is a strategic and most 
important sector in achieving the growth rate required to formulate the output of all sectors of the 
economy. Unfortunately, the sector has been one of the most affected sectors by the war in which 
caused huge destruction of its infrastructure, including production facilities, treatment plants, and 
network of oil and natural gas pipelines. In addition, the energy sector has been affected by the 
economic coercive measures imposed on the Syrian Arab Republic. The direct and indirect losses 
of the oil and gas sector, from the beginning of the war until March 2016 were estimated by 62 
billion USD, and the damage to electricity system reaches 4 billion USD, which all led to raising 
the prices of energy. 
In parallel, with the decline in productive and service economic activities and the contraction of 
GDP due to the effects of unilateral coercive economic measures ,the demand on energy sources 
has fallen between 2011 and 2016 by less than half (approximately from 25 to 10 million tons of 
oil equivalent), and Many generation plants are out of service .The overall demand for energy 
consumption, including in transportation ,industry and household sectors, has led to a significant 
reduction in emissions as a whole, including CO2 emissions from the energy sector as shown 
below: 
CO2 emissions from the energy sector (Mton CO2 equivalent  (

In fact, energy sector is facing several challenges, the most important is the improvement of the 
level of crude oil production, development of power generation capacity, restoration of the 
transmission and distribution network, financing of existing refineries improvement projects and 
the construction of new refineries to produce oil products in international specifications, in order 
to mitigate fuel combustion emissions (gasoline and fuel oil). 
 The Syrian Arab Republic has abundant renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind 
energy. And in the light of limited water resources, which are subject to extreme fluctuations 
(related to the precipitation), further regulations and policies have been adopted, in which take 
into account the environmental aspects and increase the contribution of renewable energy to 
future supply, as well as its role to improves supply security by reducing dependence on fossil 
fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the generation sector, especially during the war. 
The ratio of renewable energy is expected to reach 10% of power production by 2030 in case a 
real support by international donors is provided in order to sustain the existing initiatives and 
implement projects on the ground. 
  
2. Forests, lands and agricultural sector: 
The Syrian Arab Republic was covered with forests and trees for decades ago extended from the 
Mediterranean to the Syrian Badia, while forests covered 32% of Syrian territories last century, 
but gradually deteriorated to less than 3% due to the effect of frequent drought spells, wildfires 
and transgression of land and forest sites. 
The impacts of climate change and the war on the agriculture sector have been manifested by 
deterioration of large areas of agricultural lands (rain-fed and irrigated lands), as well as the 
damage on agricultural machines and equipment and the shortage of spare parts. In addition, the 
destruction of irrigation networks and water channels have led to the lack of agricultural crops and 
poor quality, in which has been accompanied by an unprecedented decline in the numbers of sheep, 
cows and camels. 
The quantity of GHG emissions in the agriculture sector varies by source, while in 2005, the GHG 
emissions in this sector was estimates 18% of the total GHG emissions.  
Mitigating the emission of GHG from agricultural activities requires reconsideration of existing 
farming systems ,activities in changing land-use patterns and energy consumption, taking into 
account the current and future requirements for food security and other agricultural needs. 
The government aims to develop the sector as a whole and to address the impacts of global 
warming and the war, as follows: 
- 
Organizing agricultural production according to the map of land use and determining 
appropriate agricultural rotations, according to the capacity of natural and terrestrial 
resources, in order to ensure their sustainability and increase the efficiency of their 
investment. 
8 
 
- 
Manage and manufacture agricultural waste and safe recycling of residues instead of 
burning them, and taking advantage of solid waste and liquid residues in the 
production of alternative energy by establishing modern plants. 
- 
Rehabilitation of degraded pastures and application of conservation agriculture. 
- 
Supporting renewable energy projects for agricultural uses. 
- 
Strengthening capacities and training of human resources in all branches of this sector. 
- 
Achieving a sustainable management of forest wealth and increasing forest area in 
order to develop and rehabilitate burned and degraded forests, implement integrated 
management of natural and artificial forest fires, adopt participatory approach and 
enhance extension agriculture programs, and to increase the production of forest 
plantations and forest area in the Syrian Arab Republic, so that contributing to enhance 
the role of forests in carbon sequestration. 
- 
Developing of production and productivity, and enhancing of the ability to cope the 
impact of climate change and drought, through issuing a number of national laws and 
communications, such as organizing the investment of state lands to establish 
productive and service projects for this sector; technical conditions governing the trade 
and manufacture of fertilizers; livestock and their requirements, protection of the 
desert, cultivation of pastoral shrubs and issuing the Forest Law No. 6 of 2018. 
  
3. Transport sector 
The Syrian car fleet contains more than 2 million vehicles, while a significant proportion of cars 
are old in which led, with the quality of the fuel used in their operation, to high emissions and 
poor air quality in overcrowded areas. 
The transport strategy to mitigate emissions includes the following plans and projects: 
- 
Updating and activating the technical inspection procedures in order to comply with 
the permitted percentages of the gas emission by the car exhausts, and rehabilitating 
the technical inspection lanes in the transport directorates, especially the modern and 
advanced equipment needed, such as exhaust gases. 
- 
Developing urban transportation systems and encouraging sustainable transportation, 
as well as rehabilitating and developing of railways, taking into account the role of 
railways to reduce the rates of pollution caused by other means of transportation. 
- 
Improving the quality of fuel used in transportation ,as well as the use of green fuel 
and blue gasoline. 
- 
Encouraging the use of gas-powered buses and environmentally-vehicles powered 
operated by modern technology (gas, electricity, and hybrid). 
- 
Freezing the importation or introduction of used cars more than 3 years, as well as 
following-up studies on the replacement of old vehicles currently in the transportation 
fleet. 
9 
 
4. Industry sector 
This sector is one of the main sources of GHG emission ,whether from physical and chemical 
transformations associated with various industrial processes (cement - chemical  - 
engineering 
industries) ,or as a result of fuel combustion for energy. 
The Syrian government is working to invest available national resources, relying on solar energy 
as one of the renewable sources of energy in the industry, replacing fuel with natural gas in energy-
intensive industries, such as in cement industry ,and improving the specifications of oil products 
resulting from refineries. 
The investment environment was also developed for the establishment of large and medium- 
enterprises and handicraft facilities, and rehabilitation of the affected ones. Also, the Government 
has taken necessary measures to prevent the import of production lines and used machinery and 
equipment. 
The future challenge will be represented by organizing  the industrial map in a way that meets 
environmental standards and take off industrial activities with advanced production chains, 
including the production of equipment to enhance the role of renewable energies and those used 
in energy consumption and overall mitigation of emissions, especially through rehabilitation of 
industrial wastewater treatment plants (such as the Phosphate and NOx SOx fertilizer) and the 
establishment of new ones for the generation of biogas. 
  
5. Solid waste Sector 
The solid waste management was significantly affected during the war and faced many obstacles 
and pressures in which have led to a decline the performance of this sector. The inability of local 
administrative units in some areas to reach their workplaces for the removal of solid waste, due 
to the spread out of terrorists, has led to the accumulation of large amounts of solid waste and 
prevented from moving and safe disposal such wastes. The inhabitants of these areas were forced 
to burn the wastes, so that caused the emission of harmful pollutants. Therefore, the Syrian 
government is looking forward to improve this sector, especially after the overcoming of the 
obstacles mentioned above, through a number of procedures: 
- 
Assessing the current situation of solid waste management and develop the national 
strategy in this regard. 
- 
Finding out suitable solutions for random dumps, preventing random burning and 
updating the fleet of waste management mechanisms. 
- 
Encouraging the implementation of pilot projects related to the sorting of solid waste 
from the source and treatment plants, particularly in the large cities with intensive 
economic activities. 
- 
Regulate and encourage the recycling industry, and develop standards for necessary 
facilities and equipments. 
- 
Conversion of sanitary landfill gases into energy (and utilization of biogas). 
10 
 
The Syrian Arab Republic has not received a significant international support in the field of 
integrated solid waste management in which consider as a priority of priorities for the recovery 
phase, in particular to ensure an appropriate environment for the return of internally displaced 
persons and refugees to their areas and normal life. 
  
6. Housing sector 
During the war, the housing sector in several governorates faced destruction and vandalism by 
armed groups in which targeted infrastructure, industrial units & factories, residential buildings 
and places of worship. Therefore, this sector face (faces) a major challenge in rehabilitating the 
affected areas in terms of the lack of machineries and equipments to remove, demolish, sort, 
recycle and utilize the damaged buildings according to specific areas, in addition to the need of 
sustainable rehabilitating the infrastructure in a sustainable manner. 
Despite of these challenges, the Government is making great efforts to develop rehabilitation 
mechanisms for the affected areas in the reconstruction phase and to design and develop modern 
and sustainable urban communities through the housing map, issuing evidences of damage 
assessment and adopting the required interventions that meet the structural, environmental, as 
well as energy conservation criteria. This will be achieved by the following steps: 
- 
Setting standards and regulations that take into consideration the environmental 
factors and allow the investment of alternative and renewable energies, the 
preservation of agricultural lands and the creation of a modern infrastructure and 
services system. 
- 
Developing areas outside cities to reduce rural-urban migration by providing decent 
jobs and livelihood, as well as and housing that meets the requirements of green 
architecture. 
- 
Following up the application of the green architecture guide effectively, and encourage 
the use of modern environmental technologies such as the production and use of 
environmentally building materials and thermal insulation techniques.

4. Adaptation Measures 
A national strategy and plan of action for adaptation to climate change has been proposed through 
the preparation of the initial national communication on climate change, aimed at improving the 
management of natural resources and promoting environmental sustainability. This action plan 
identified priority measures for adapting with climate change. However, due to the current 
circumstances and exacerbated environmental challenges, none of these measures and procedures 
has been implemented. Therefore, the strategy and plan of action needs to be developed and 
adjusted according to current conditions and possibilities, as well as the future visions and 
international support for this plan. 
The following actions aim to promote adaptation to address climate change and to increase 
resilience to its impacts. The implementation of these measures will require cooperation between 
all sectors of the economy on the national level, in addition to international cooperation and 
support, as well as providing financial resources to enable the Syrian Arab Republic to protect 
natural systems and human health. 
  
1. Water resources management 
The priorities for water scarcity adaptation are to reduce vulnerability and focus on sustainability 
of agricultural production and protection of the environment. This requires significant changes in 
the management of water resources, policies and associated infrastructure. Water scarcity 
adaptation in the agricultural sector could include: 
- 
Protecting of water resources (and preventing pollution of surface and groundwater 
resources). 
- 
Reducing water losses, reducing water leakage from canals, and maintaining soil 
moisture by improving their organic matter content. 
- 
Raising the efficiency of irrigation water use, support water harvesting projects, using 
highly efficient irrigation methods, and providing actual quantities of water needed by 
plants, as well as using supplementary irrigation to irrigate rain crops during droughts.  
- 
Enhancing the use of non-traditional water resources (treated sewage and agricultural 
drainage, supporting industrial wastewater treatment plants for large rivers, such as 
Euphrates River and Orontes River, typical village treatment plants, spatial treatment 
plants for small communities, and producing irrigation water). 
- 
Improvement of the current agricultural practices  ( changing sowing dates and 
deepening, improving plant nutrition, using of crops with low water needs, drought- 
resistant crops, diversification of cultivated crops, combination of crop cultivation, 
domestic animal  husbandry, providing agricultural and rural extension services to 
both males and females, strengthen market linkages). 
   
12 
 
2. Conservation of biodiversity 
The fifth national report of the Convention on Biological Diversity (2016) noted that there are7213 
types of documented species in which belong to the most important vital groups in the Syrian Arab 
Republic. Despite the richness of biodiversity, it suffers from critical conditions due to the 
deterioration of some ecosystems, especially in forests, and the decline or disappearance of some 
wild plants, as well as the low density or disappearance of some wild animals. 
The Syrian Arab Republic has continued to follow its commitments to the international 
conventions and protocols, in particular the Convention on Biological Diversity and other 
important protocols, including Nagoya Protocol for the Protection of Plant and Animal Genetic 
Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of the Benefits Resulting from it adopted in 2012, 
and accession to the Nagoya Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol to the Cartagena Protocol on 
Biosafety in 2012. It also works to protect the components of biodiversity and the sustainable 
development of natural resources. Adaptation actions here could include: 
- 
Establishment of temporary nurseries for the propagation of endangered plants. 
- 
Rehabilitation of damaged Reserves during the previous years, and the streamlining 
of the participatory principle in its management. 
- 
Conducting surveys and documentation of degraded forest areas and affected animal 
and plant species. 
- 
Supporting forestry and agricultural reserves and increasing the number of natural 
protected areas. 
- 
Motivate local communities economically and provide local alternatives to improve 
the economic situation of the local population, and promote the establishment of 
medium and small rural handicraft, traditional and food industries in the Badia in order 
to increase employment opportunities, combat poverty and prevent the depletion of 
natural resources. 
 
3. Combating Land Degradation and Desertification 
The Syria Arab Republic suffers from the phenomenon of desertification and land degradation, 
especially agricultural ones, which negatively affect the lives of many people and pose a threat to 
national food security and quality of life. In addition to its follow-up within the framework of the 
Convention on Desertification and Drought Mitigation, the proposed measures to address these 
challenges will be as follows: 
- 
Achieving land degradation neutrality and improve management practices, 
particularly in the agriculture and forestry sectors. 
- 
Preparation of programs and plans for the reduction and rehabilitation of soil 
degradation and conducting drift measurements in degraded areas by setting up test 
stations, preparation of soil degradation risk maps using remote sensing, monitoring 
and GIS techniques and implementation of projects for the rehabilitation of affected 
areas. 
13 
 
- 
Developing studies and methods for identifying and controlling dust storms in affected 
or threatened areas through the use of green belts and barriers, as well as studying 
suitable plant species to mitigate the effects of long-term dust storms that are 
appropriate to the conditions of the region. 
 
4. Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plans 
Many necessary measures have been adopted to develop and implement integrated coastal zone 
management plans, taking into account the protection of coastal infrastructure, such as roads, 
buildings, ports, etc., in addition to capacity building of relevant institutions and public awareness 
on this matter. 
In this context, the Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms the necessity of an immediate implementation 
of the relevant UN resolutions in which request “Israel”, the occupying Power, to resume its 
responsibilities for repairing the environmental damage, including the restoration of the Syrian 
marine environment, as a result to the massive destruction by the Israeli Air Force in 2006 of the 
oil storage tanks in the direct vicinity of the Jiyah electric power plant in Lebanon, resulting in an 
oil slick covered the entirety of the Lebanese coastline, extended to the Syrian coastline and 
hindered efforts to achieve sustainable development. 
  
5. Development of early warning systems 
It’s very fundamental that developing countries developed early warning systems for monitoring 
droughts and extreme weather conditions such as rainstorms, floods and dust storms in order to 
increase the capacity of the infrastructure and improve readiness to resilience. However, this target 
requires technical and financial support by developed countries for access to computer systems, 
monitoring technologies, remote sensing techniques, analysis methodologies and globally applied 
programs for drought forecasting, climate variability and storms. 
   
5. Time Frame 
This document contains the future visions and policies for addressing the impacts of climate 
change in the Syrian Arab Republic for the period 2020-2030. The projects are implemented 
according to national priorities for sustainable development. Estimates and visions will be adjusted 
according to the level of development, progress and information provided by different sectors. 
  
  
14 
 
  
6. Means of Implementation 
The Syrian Arab Republic stresses the necessity of continuing efforts to achieve the objectives of 
the Paris Agreement and the importance of the international cooperation to achieve the purpose of 
these contributions, especially in the area of: 
- 
Building capacity and expertise in order to support the implementation of said 
contributions. 
- 
Raising awareness and developing sustainable awareness regarding to climate change, 
as well as establishing a participatory approach with the public, and enhancing the role 
of local communities in formulating and implementing of development programs. 
- 
Developing less GHG production technologies and transferring appropriate 
environment technologies in all sectors, particularly in the areas of: 
 Savings in water consumption, recycling and collection, irrigation and 
sustainable management for agricultural purposes; 
 Improving the efficiency of energy production consumption and 
environmental sustainability. 
 Early warning systems for severe weather events (e.g. floods, storms and 
droughts). 
 Transport techniques that are flexible and able to be resilient the negative 
impacts of climate change, and minimizing emissions from transportation. 
 Supporting Integrated Solid Waste Management. 
- 
Supporting and developing scientific research as an essential tool and a process to 
promote and develop appropriate new technological responses in order to address the 
impacts of climate change to all economic activities and sectors in which have direct 
and indirect impacts on society. 
- 
Protecting forests from deforestation, especially fires and cutting, planting new areas, 
and rehabilitating degraded sites in accordance to annual plans. 
The Syrian Arab Republic strongly reaffirms that implementation of these contributions, requires 
full and serious commitment from developed countries to provide an adequate and predictable 
financial support to developing countries, under the international environmental conventions, 
including UNFCCC, in order to fulfill their national plans in the contexts of Paris Agreement, as 
well as guarantees that funds and funding mechanisms which accessible for developing countries 
in order to analyze needs and opportunities for developing their national programs, and 
encouraging investment in projects contributing to mitigation and adaptation to the impacts of 
climate change.

Nationally Determined Contribution
1. Introduction
As a developing country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,
Thailand attaches great importance to the global efforts to address this common and pressing
challenge. Thailand enhanced its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) at the 26th
Conference of the Parties (COP26) to fulfill the long-term temperature goal set in Article 2 of
the Paris Agreement. Pursuant to decision 1/CP.21 and decision 1/CMA.3, Thailand hereby
communicates its updated NDC and the relevant information, described in the annex of the
decision 4/CMA.1, as applicable.
2. Mitigation Component
Thailand intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from the projected
business-as-usual (BAU) level by 2030. The level of contribution could increase up to 40
percent, subject to adequate and enhanced access to technology development and transfer,
financial resources and capacity building support. Furthermore, Thailand will continue
vigorous efforts in its challenge to meet the long-term goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and
net-zero greenhouse gas emission by 2065.

Planning processes To ensure that the NDC is realistic and achievable, its
preparation was fundamentally based on the linkage
between climate action and national development
priorities, including social and economic development
and poverty eradication. Integration of the NDC into
country strategies, long-term economic and social
development plans, sectoral plans, and local plans is
essential to secure successful implementation and
contribution.
NDC Preparation:
Thailand's NDC was developed through a participatory- 2 -
process. Stakeholder consultations were conducted
through the establishment of an inter-ministerial working
group and steering committee comprising representatives
from relevant sectoral agencies, academia, and the private
sector. The NDC was formulated based on the following
plans:
- 13th National Economic and Social Development
Plan 2023-2027
- National Energy Plan Framework 2022
- Climate Change Master Plan B.E. 2558–2593
(2015-2050)
- Power Development Plan B.E. 2561–2580 (2018-
2037)
- Thailand Smart Grid Development Master Plan
B.E. 2558-2579 (2015-2036)
- Energy Efficiency Plan B.E. 2561–2580 (2018-
2037)
- Alternative Energy Development Plan B.E. 2561–
2580 (2018-2037)
- Master Plan for Sustainable Transport System and
Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts (2013-2030)
- National Industrial Development Master Plan B.E.
2555–2574 (2012-2031)
- Waste Management Roadmap
Implementation Plans:
Thailand's NDC target has been integrated into the
National Strategy. It will be implemented through the
NDC Sectoral Action Plan which will be carried out with
a wide range of stakeholder consultation and public
participation processes at the national and local levels.
The NDC Sectoral Action Plan will identify emission
reduction measures, targets and responsibilities of
relevant agencies in energy, transport, industry, waste and
agriculture sectors.
Assumptions and Metric:
methodological - Global warming potential on a 100-year timescale in
approaches accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report
- National statistics, including sector activity and
socioeconomic forecasts
GHG Inventory:
Thailand’s GHG inventory based on the 2006 IPCC
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
International market-based cooperation
Thailand intends to achieve the unconditional mitigation
target under this NDC through domestic efforts, while
recognizing the important role of international market-
based cooperation in contributing to the mitigation of
greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable- 3 -
development. Thailand welcomes discussion to explore
international market-based cooperation in the context of
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, that promotes
development and transfer of advanced technologies and
innovation and provides access to financial resources that
support Thailand's achievement of NDC and LT-LEDS.
2.2 Consideration on fairness and ambition in light of national circumstances
2.2.1 Thailand’s national circumstances
Thailand is a developing country highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change
and is ranked the 9th country in the ""extreme risk"" category that is most vulnerable to future
climate change impacts over the next thirty years. Thailand’s GHG emissions represent less
than 1% of global emissions and are lower than the world average. In terms of emission
profile, the energy sector has been the largest contributor to Thailand’s GHG emission,
accounting for 69.06% of total emission in 2018, as reflected in the country’s 4th National
Communication.
2.2.2 Thailand’s efforts
Thailand places high priority on climate change as one of the key challenges
affecting communities’ livelihood, economic growth and the achievement of sustainable
development. Thailand has incorporated climate change into its national economic and social
development plans since 2007. Climate change is currently addressed at the highest policy
level under the National Strategy (2018-2037) to ensure a long-term continuity of the issue
alongside other economic and social considerations, including poverty eradication. The
Climate Change Master Plan 2015-2050 reflects on climate change mitigation, adaptation,
capacity building and cross-cutting issues. Ambitious energy targets are put forward in the
Power Development Plan (PDP), the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) and the
Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP). The Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan
promotes a road-to-rail modal shift for both freight and passenger transport. A vehicle tax
scheme based on CO emission was introduced in 2016 to promote low carbon vehicles. The
2
Waste Management Roadmap promotes waste-to-energy technologies and also actively
implements the 3Rs principle. The National Forest Policy is adopted to ensure a sustainable
management of forest in Thailand. The commitment to increase forest cover of the country to
achieve 55% of the total country area by 2037 has been setup under the 20-Year National
Strategy. Although the NDC target in 2030 excludes the land use, land-use change, and
forestry sector as part of its implementation, the protection and conservation of forest has
been implemented continuously to be a good basis for future actions. There are a number of
regulations in place in Thailand related to the management and maintenance of the national
forest estate. A range of projects and programs have been implemented to solve issues
surrounding forest loss, including activities related to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation
and Forest Degradation in Developing countries and the role of conservation, sustainable
management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries
(REDD+). However, Thailand also needs sufficient support to overcome its challenges for
enhancing and maintaining the carbon sink in its long-term mitigation goal.
Thailand has several continuous success stories in its ongoing efforts to achieve its
greenhouse gas reduction goals. Thailand’s NAMAs target to reduce GHG emission by
7-20% by 2020 below business-as-usual (BAU) includes measures in energy and transport
sectors. Under NAMAs, we have achieved a GHG emission reduction of 15.4% in 2020
which lays a solid foundation for our post-2020 efforts. In 2022, public-private partnerships
have enabled further progress in collaboration between government, cement industry and- 4 -
relevant agencies to encourage all sectors to use hydraulic cement in all types of construction
projects. As a result of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2020, the
cement sector was able to achieve its greenhouse gas reduction targets earlier than expected.
The cement industry also expressed its intention of a more ambitious target to be achieved by
2023 that will support the government's policy on carbon neutrality and net zero greenhouse
gas emissions in 2050 and 2065, respectively. Moreover, Thailand held the first national
climate conference to awaken efforts towards achieving the country’s goal of reaching net
zero emissions after COP26. The conference was attended by all stakeholders including
public and private sectors, provincial governments, academics, international partners and
organizations to build strong engagement on climate actions to ensure a whole-of-government
and whole-of-society approach to address the climate crisis and meet the national targets.
In addition to mitigation efforts, Thailand has treated adaptation as equally
important. Thailand has developed our first National Adaptation Plan to provide a framework
towards a climate-resilient society with the focus on water management, agriculture and food
security, tourism, health, natural resource management, and human settlement and security.
The NAP aims to minimize risks and vulnerability as well as to improve resilience of the
country in accordance with a sustainable development pathway. Thailand has integrated
climate change adaptation into key sectoral policies and plans such as the draft Action Plan
for Climate Change in Agriculture (2023 – 2027), the Climate Change Adaptation Plan on
Public Health (2018 – 2030), the 20-year Water Resource Management Master Plan, and the
Spatial Plans.
2.2.3 Thailand’s challenges and limitations
It is important to incorporate concerns that several of the proposed measures and
actions in these ambitious plans are subject to very high investment and operating costs,
particularly costs of technologies and infrastructures which can become an important barrier
to successful implementation of the plans.
Some of the key barriers for the energy sector include, for instance, limitation of
grid connection due to inadequate capacity of transmission lines, lack of support by financial
institutions for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, lack of domestic
technological and technical resources and negative public perception particularly against
waste-to-energy and biomass power plants. Several measures require a high level of technical
capacity and effective coordination across different sectoral agencies, whereas such technical
capacity and effective coordination in a developing country like Thailand is currently lacking.
For renewable energy development in particular, the International Energy Agency also cited
some of the above-mentioned barriers as common barriers for renewable energy deployment
in developing countries. Domestically, Thailand has launched several support mechanisms
such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and access to investment grants and venture capital to
promote renewable energy. However, to achieve ambitious and more rapid renewable energy
deployment, incentives have to be created for technology developers to cooperate and share
technology knowledge to enable technology transfer on a larger scale. International financial
support mechanisms such as technical assistance and technology transfer funds for purchasing
intellectual property rights for a free distribution of clean energy technologies would be very
valuable to accelerate diffusion of renewable energy technologies for developing countries.
Furthermore, efforts are needed to inform the public, through lessons-learned and
experience sharing from other countries, as well as showcasing success stories from pilot or
demonstration projects. It is therefore crucial that international cooperation through the
UNFCCC focuses on these cooperative attempts to unlock the potential of developing
countries in their contributions towards the global solutions to climate change by addressing
these important identified barriers, making technological solutions more affordable for- 5 -
developing countries and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to implement
these solutions more effectively and more sustainably. Successful implementation of these
ambitious mitigation plans in Thailand, in addition to our domestic efforts, will be subject to
adequate and predictable access to enhanced means of implementation agreed under the
UNFCCC.
3. Adaptation Component
Thailand has developed the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) with the aim to build adaptive
capacity and enhance climate resilience in 6 priority sectors including water resources
management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resources
management, and human settlements and security.
National adaptation priorities - Water resources management sector aims to
increase water security and reduce loss and damage
from water-related disasters by developing mechanisms
and approaches for integrated water resources
management and building adaptive capacity and climate
resilience to manage climate risks in water resources
management.
- Agriculture and food security sector aims to
maintain productivity and food security by increasing
the ability to respond and manage climate risks in the
agricultural sector.
- Tourism sector aims to strengthen the capacity of the
tourism sector towards climate resilience and
sustainable growth by enhancing disaster management
and climate risk reduction.
- Public health sector aims to enhance the capacity of
the public health system to manage health risks and
reduce health impacts from climate change by
developing health impact surveillance and prevention
mechanisms and enhancing access to good quality
public health services.
- Natural resources management sector aims to
sustainably manage natural resources and biodiversity to
respond to climate change impacts by enhancing the
conservation, rehabilitation, and sustainable use of
natural resources and biodiversity and strengthening
public participation.
- Human settlements and security sector aims to
enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, and
cities, to adapt to climate change impacts in accordance
with the local context by developing mechanisms to
manage climate risks and impacts.
Planning Processes Thailand’s NAP was developed through a participatory
process of extensive stakeholder consultations with
involvement by representatives from relevant
government agencies, technical experts, academia, civil
society, international organizations and private sectors
as well as vulnerable groups to identify climate impacts,- 6 -
vulnerability and adaptation gaps and needs; analyze
current climate and future climate change projection,
assess climate risks, and identify adaptation measures in
6 sectors.
The main principles taken into account in formulating
Thailand’s NAP include Sufficient Economy
Philosophy, local wisdom, sustainable development,
Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA), Community-based
adaptation (CbA), proactive principle, resource
efficiency, good governance, public participation,
human rights and gender responsiveness.
Timeframe 2020 – 2037
(Thailand will periodically monitor and evaluate the
progress of NAP implementation and will revise and
update it, as appropriate.)
Adaptation action’s Thailand’s NAP has taken into account the linkages
contribution to other between climate change adaptation under UNFCCC and
international frameworks other Conventions and agreements, such as the United
and/or conventions Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD), the Convention on Biological Diversity
(CBD), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 - 2030
(SFDRR) and the Convention on Wetland (Ramsar
Convention).
4. Support Needs
Climate change adaptation and mitigation are becoming more deeply embedded in
governmental structures in line with the increasing profile of climate actions in national
agendas. Thailand has established the inter-ministerial committees to oversee climate policy
development and implementation and comprehensive national systems to monitor, evaluate
and report on progress. However, there are still gaps in individual and institutional capacities
in all relevant agencies, including governmental agencies, private sectors, and general public.
The provision of support and cooperation on climate actions are important to achieving
mitigation and adaptation objectives and increasing ambition.
Various challenges were identified during NDC and NAP preparation such as uncertainties
of climate change and its impacts, lack of data and research on coping capacities and
vulnerabilities in sectors and local area, lack of tools and methods to support implementation,
and a lot of institutional barriers to encompass sectoral and political boundaries. Moreover,
the global outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has dramatically threatened the way
people conduct their daily life. The so-called “New Normal” that emerges after the pandemic
will reshape many economic and social activities. As Thailand plans its recovery from this
pandemic, we aim to use this opportunity to build back better an ecosystem and economy that
promotes climate-resilient and sustainable development, including through the
implementation of the NDC. To meet this transition, support, namely financial, technology
development and transfer, and capacity building, in the following areas is crucial to drive
effective and realistic implementation of Thailand’s NDC.- 7 -

potentials, cost-benefit analysis, and gender sensitivity.
- Technical support to apply the top-down analysis for GHG emission reduction
approaches for policy makers to identify the specific/sectoral targets.
- Capacity building of sectoral and subnational agencies to integrate adaptation and
mitigation measures into their respective planning processes.
- Support for sectoral agencies to develop climate resilient index in 6 sectors under
NAP, namely, water resources management, agriculture and food security, tourism,
public health, natural resources management, and human settlements and security to
provide updated information and climate resilient evaluation for both policy makers
and the general public.
- Support to promote, develop and implement formal and non-formal education and
training programs as well as to strengthen teachers and educators focusing on climate
change at all levels.
- Awareness-raising for relevant stakeholders and the general public on climate change
and NDC.
4.2 Technology Development and Transfer

INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTION (iNDC) UNDER THE
UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
Executive Summary
Trinidad and Tobago's intended nationally determined contribution (iNDC) is based on its
Carbon Reduction Strategy developed for its power generation, transportation and industrial
sectors, these being the major emitting sectors of the economy, and consistent with
implementing the provisions of the National Climate Change Policy. The process of
developing the Strategy and hence the iNDC involved wide stakeholder consultation and
participation, including through its Climate Change Focal Point Network consisting of over
175 representatives of government ministries, agencies and institutions, academia, the
private and industrial sectors, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations,
and fiduciary organisations. This process was finalised in 2014 and lasted for three (3) years
during which business-as-usual scenarios were developed for each sector to the year 2040
although the iNDC presented goes to the year 2030, involving a conservative (lower
economic growth) and optimistic (higher economic growth).
Mitigation options were identified which underwent cost-benefit analyses and socio-
economic impact assessment and includes policy instruments, knowledge and awareness
approaches to elicit behavioural changes and direct technology intervention options such as
clean technology, fuel switching and renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. Due
to a lack of sufficient data sets, the methodology to estimate projected emissions was developed
as an ad hoc model based on the BIOS model.
Trinidad and Tobago's aim is to achieve a reduction objective in overall emissions from the
three sectors by 15% by 2030 from BAU, which in absolute terms is an equivalent of one
hundred and three million tonnes (103,000,000) of CO e. The estimated cost of meeting this
2
objective is USD 2 billion, which is expected to be met partly through domestic funding and
conditional on international financing including through the Green Climate Fund. In this
regard, Trinidad and Tobago will commit to unconditionally reduce its public transportation
emissions by 30% or one million, seven hundred thousand tonnes (1,700,000) CO e
2
compared to 2013 levels by December 31, 2030.
1Trinidad and Tobago's National Circumstances
Trinidad and Tobago is the most industrialized economy in the English-speaking Caribbean. It is the
leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its economy is mainly based upon these resources.
Trinidad and Tobago also supplies manufactured goods, mainly food products and beverages, as well
as cement, to the Caribbean region. Even though other products are also manufactured, oil and gas is
the leading economic sector and accounts for 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 80% of
exports. Trinidad and Tobago does not contribute largely to the total worldwide GHG emissions. In
fact, as of 2013, Trinidad and Tobago was ranked 62nd of all the countries if they were classified by
total national GHG emissions.
There are several studies that found evidence of recent changes in the climate in Trinidad and Tobago.
It has been shown that, over the last three (3) decades, there has been an upward trend in temperatures.
The Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service (TTMS) found that the annual mean air temperature
has warmed over the period 1981-2010 by 0.8 and 0.5 ºC relative to 1961-1990 and 1971-1990, for
Trinidad and Tobago respectively. That anomalous warming per decade is consistent with those
observed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) for the Caribbean region.
In terms of vulnerability to the effects of climate change, Trinidad and Tobago’s exposure to possible
impacts has been well documented. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), the country is
vulnerable to temperature increases, changes in precipitation and sea level rise. Other vulnerabilities
include increased flooding, increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, hillside erosion and loss
of coastal habitats. In fact, even though Trinidad and Tobago is not in the main Atlantic hurricane belt,
one of the new natural hazards scenarios considered for the country is the increased potential to be hit
by tropical storms.
In light of the expected climate change impacts for Trinidad and Tobago and, taking into account its
fossil fuel based economy, taking action to implement climate change mitigation policies in the country
is deemed as a necessity to reduce climate change impacts and assume responsibility for the country’s
GHG emissions. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has recognised the importance of addressing
climate change both from a mitigation and adaptation perspective and is committed to playing its part
as a responsible member of the global community, and as a signatory to the UNFCCC, to making
efforts to achieve the objective of the UNFCCC, regardless of the quantum of emissions on a global
scale.
Accordingly the Government has defined the policy framework for a low carbon development plan
through the National Climate Change Policy, and developed a Carbon Reduction Strategy for the
power generation, transportation and industrial sectors which forms the basis of Trinidad and Tobago's
iNDC. Trinidad and Tobago already produces all of its electricity from natural gas and is
working towards achieving greater efficiency through combined cycle generation at all its power
plants. This sector would therefore be at the edge of low carbon emissions with renewable energy
being the next stage for reducing emissions even further. The objective therefore is to achieve
the optimal energy mix with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions in order to achieve sustainable
development, including the decoupling of emissions and economic growth.
2Therefore, implementing the provisions of the National Climate Change Policy is critical and necessary
to ensure a sustainable development path that will redound to the benefits of society as a whole in the
short, medium and long terms. Building climate resilience through the reduction of carbon emissions
and reducing climate vulnerability in all sectors will create green jobs and have significant co-benefits
from an air quality and associated public health costs perspective, as well as enhance the coping ability
and capacity to the adverse impacts of climate change.
The following sections provide further details.
3Trinidad and Tobago's Mitigation Contribution
Mitigation Objectives
Unconditional: 30% reduction in GHG emissions by December 31, 2030 in the public
transportation sector compared to a business as usual (BAU) scenario
(reference year 2013).1
Conditional: Additional reduction achievable under certain
conditions which would bring the total GHG reduction to 15% below
BAU emission levels by December 31, 2030.
Financial The estimated cost of achieving the reduction objectives is USD 2
Requirements: billion, which is expected to be met partly through domestic funding
and conditional on international climate financing including through
the Green Climate Fund.
Methodological The BAU baseline was developed using an ad hoc model based on the
Approaches: BIOS tool, rather than the wholesale application of prefabricated
models. This decision was taken as a result of various criteria applied
to the Trinidad and Tobago situation as summarised in the table
below.
Evaluation criteria Prefabricated Ad-hoc model Situation of Trinidad
model and Tobago
Transparency Black box High Needed for a better
understanding of the
situation
Data requirement High Adaptable Data available ,with some
gaps
Flexibility/adaptability None High Necessary to cover the
data gaps
Legitimacy Generally high Depending on its Both types could be used
strengths for the situation of
Trinidad and Tobago
Therefore, the model could be described as a simulation model, designed to develop the GHG
emissions projections based on some specific sectoral assumptions and other, more general, economic
assumptions which link the three (3) sectors.
The main features of the model are:
1. The economic module, which forecasts the general economic growth of Trinidad and Tobago
and that of the sectors, according to some assumptions and scenarios generated.
2. The sectoral submodels, which develop the technical specificities of every sector, according
to the forecasts of the economic module.
1 Trinidad and Tobago will continue to revise the BAU projections as more data becomes available to better track
emission reduction efforts.
43. The emissions module, which converts the activity data into GHG emissions, according to
the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
The development of the future scenarios is based on projections of the World Bank for Trinidad and
Tobago and the Caribbean2. The scenario developed shows a lower economic growth and is therefore
defined as the conservative scenario, while the growth expected for the Caribbean is higher, so it was
used as the baseline for the optimistic scenario. The scenarios have an important influence on the GHG
emissions. Firstly, it is due to the relationship between the demand growth and the GHG emissions.
And secondly, because in a long term projection, structural transformations of the economy take place,
reflecting the differences between the relative weights of the economic sectors, and affecting the GHG
emissions.
Type of Emissions Reductions: Emission reduction from projected emissions based a
business as usual scenario to the year 2030.
Sectors: Transportation, power generation and industry.
Gases: Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide
Fairness and Ambition: Trinidad and Tobago is a small island developing state
with the attendant limitations of small size, limited
technological, technical, financial and human
resources, relatively small economy, accounting for less
than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions and more
critically, acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of
climate change. Notwithstanding, the Government of
Trinidad and Tobago has placed equal importance on
mitigation and adaptation because it recognises the need
for developing a low carbon economy in order to assist
in the achievement of sustainable development
objectives. To this end, Trinidad and Tobago has begun
to put in place the necessary policy and legislative
framework and has committed to unconditional
mitigation action consistent with the implementation of
the National Climate Change Policy.
2 “Real Projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Growth Rates of GDP for Baseline Countries/Regions (in billions of 2005 dollars)
2000-2030”. World Bank World Development Indicators, International Financial Statistics of the IMF, IHS Global Insight, and Oxford
Economic Forecasting, as well as estimated and projected values developed by the Economic Research Service all converted to a 2005
base year.
5Additionally, robust policy measures for forest, land use and natural resources management are
underway that will result in greater mitigation of greenhouse gases but which are not included as part
of the iNDC. Trinidad and Tobago’s iNDC therefore goes beyond the requirements of the provisions
made for SIDS in Paragraph 11 of Decision 1/CP.20. Furthermore, the Energy Chamber of Trinidad
and Tobago is developing a feasible carbon trading scheme that will also result in reduced emissions
in the industrial sector.
Contribution to The Government of Trinidad and Tobago recognises the legally
achieving the objective binding commitment of all Parties to achieving the objective of
of the UNFCCC: the UNFCCC as articulated in its Article 2 and the need for
mitigation action by all Parties regardless of their quantum of
emissions. The mitigation efforts of Trinidad and Tobago along
with those of all Parties will collectively contribute to the
reduction of global atmospheric concentration of greenhouse
gases and the achievement of the objective of the UNFCCC.
Explanatory Notes
BAU Scenario: The estimated emissions to 2030 are based on the Business-As-Usual (BAU)
projections modeled, and calculated as the average of the emissions projected of both the optimistic
scenario and the conservative scenarios.
1. Emissions Reduction by 2030: The emissions reduction objective is intended to be a reduction
of the cumulative emissions of the three sectors (power generation, industry and transport)
between 2013 and 2030, and aimed to be achieved by 31 December 2030. These cumulative
emissions are referenced against a 2013 baseline in which the total emissions from these sectors
amounted to an estimated 34,234,032 tCO2-e.
2. Sectors: The sectors covered are the three major emitting sectors (power generation, industry
and transportation) as the emissions from the other sectors are considered relatively negligible.
For example, in 2010, the land use and agriculture sector accounted for 2% of total economy-
wide emissions, while the waste sector accounted for 7% of the total economy-wide emissions.
3. Global Warming Potential (GWP): GWP used were consistent with the 1996 IPCC
Guidelines and applied in estimating projected emissions.

Introduction
Ukraine as a Party of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
(hereinafter – UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, recognizing the need for an
effective and progressive response to the urgent threat of climate change and in
accordance with decision 1/CP.19, prepared its Intended Nationally Determined
Contribution (hereinafter - INDC) that was approved by the Governmental Decree
dated September 16, 2015 # 980 and submitted it to the Secretariat of UNFCCC on
September 19, 2016. Ukraine defined its target not to exceed 60 % of the 1990
greenhouse gas emissions (hereinafter - GHG) level in 2030.
Ukraine made a significant contribution to reducing global GHG emissions. As of
2019, GHG emissions in Ukraine decreased by 62.4% from the level of 1990
(including the sector «Land use, land-use change and forestry» (hereinafter -
LULUCF) and by 64.8% from the level of 1990 (excluding the sector LULUCF).
Following the decision 1/CP.21, that requests those Parties whose INDC pursuant to
decision 1/CP.20 contains a time frame up to 2030 to communicate or update by 2020
these contributions and to do so every five years thereafter pursuant to Article 4,
paragraph 9, of the Paris Agreement, Ukraine is introducing its Updated Nationally
Determined Contribution (hereinafter - NDC).
Despite the ongoing military aggression of the Russian Federation and temporary
occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol, as well as
certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the economic crisis of 2014-2015 and
the COVID-19 pandemic, Ukraine has taken many steps to significantly reduce
energy consumption, development of energy efficiency and renewable energy.
The share of renewable energy in electricity production increased from a total 7.9 %
in 2015 to 11.3 % in 2020. During 2012-2019, there was also a significant reduction
in the energy intensity of GDP. Among the important reforms the state program on
energy efficiency and local co-financing programs should also be noted, which
involved more than 860,000 families during 2014-2020. Moreover, the Energy
Efficiency Fund was able to raise funds for energy efficiency and saved around 50 %
on household bills. In 2020 it was also extended to budgetary institutions, such as
schools, hospitals and others.
Since 2016, Ukraine has operated an energy service mechanism for the
implementation of energy efficiency measures at municipal and state-owned facilities
(budget institutions, such as schools, kindergartens). In total, from 2016 to 2020,
more than 550 ESCO contracts were concluded, which contributed to energy savings
of 35 %.2
Based on geographical, economic and social circumstances, Ukraine has committed
itself to achieving the target of reducing GHG emissions of 65% by 2030, compared
to 1990 (including LULUCF), reaching carbon neutrality until 2060 as foreseen in the
National Economic Strategy until 2030, approved by the Decree of the Cabinet of
Ministers of Ukraine of March 3, 2021 # 179.
The Ukrainian NDC includes GHG emissions and targets for its uncontrolled and
occupied territories, however the detailed information on the economic activities and
GHG emissions on those territories is missing. This fact complicates, and sometimes
makes impossible to collect and report data needed for the annual National GHG
Inventory. Thus, for emission and reduction estimations on the temporarily occupied
territory of Ukraine an expert estimation was performed.
After the reestablishment of Ukraine’s control over occupied and uncontrolled
territories, the Ukrainian NDC should be adjusted according to the updated and
verified data.

leadership of the National Government of Ukraine
and in cooperation with a team of national and
international experts, provided through the technical

organizations.
The Working Group was gathered 5 times (February
2019, July 2019, February 2020, May 2020,
November 2020) at every stage of the process to
present and collect comments on the input data,6
methodologies selected, preliminary modelling
results and final documents. All the reports were also
published at the website of the Ministry with open
public access.
In the frame of preparing NDC gender analysis was
also conducted and recommendations were made to
analyse the status of different groups of women and
men in the areas involved in climate change
mitigation, analysis of women's access to climate
policy decision-making, as well as the impact of
gender on readiness to accept and promote change in
various sectors of economy, impact of climate
change on gender and analysis for gender equality in
Ukraine.
In order to analyse modelled scenarios and discuss
possibilities to achieve GHG emission reduction
targets and attract necessary investments, more than
20 additional meetings were organized with the main
sectoral stakeholders.
Contextual matters,
including, inter alia, as
appropriate:
Ukraine is located in the eastern Europe and is one of
the largest countries in terms of territory (603,628
km2) and population (42 million people). The forest
in Ukraine covers around 15,9 % of the total territory
of the country. 6 % of the country’s territory is
protected. Agricultural lands in Ukraine cover 68 %
of the territory.
National circumstances,
GDP per capita in 2020 was USD 3726.94. Total
such as geography, climate,
GDP in 2020 accounted for USD 155.6 billion (in
economy, sustainable
current prices).
development and poverty
eradication In 2020 GDP per capita in Ukraine was 5.2 times
lower than the average in Central Europe.
Ukraine ranks 56th in the world by the size of
nominal GDP in absolute terms, and 119th by size of
GDP per capita.
After the economic crisis Ukraine will reach the level
of the nominal GDP of 2013 only in 2021.7
Despite progress in the fight against poverty, the
number of people whose daily spending is lower than
the established purchasing power parity (USD 5.05)
increased from 1% in 2014 to 2.2% in 2015. In 2015
the number of people whose total expenses were
lower than the actual living wage increased more
than twice (from 28.6% to 58.3%).
One of the main obstacles on the way to achieving
GHG emissions reduction is the armed aggression of
the Russian Federation and temporary occupation of
the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the city of
Sevastopol as well as certain areas of Donetsk and
Luhansk regions (approximately 7 percent of the
territory of Ukraine), which requires significant
political, financial and human resources for
protection of the territorial integrity and sovereignty
of Ukraine.
The ongoing military aggression of the Russian
Federation against Ukraine has a strong negative
impact on the overall economic situation in Ukraine
and has led to a reduction in industrial production.
All of the above-mentioned factors together with low
incomes of the population lead to energy poverty.
According to the results of the survey, the majority of
the population of the country considers payment for
utilities to be quite problematic. In 2019, 65 % of the
population applied for state subsidies to pay for
utilities.
Ukraine has substantially reduced GHG emissions
since 1990 due to transformations that did not lead to
steady economic growth. The total amount of GHG
emissions in Ukraine in 2019 amounted to 332.2 Mt
CO equivalent (including LULUCF) that is 37.6 %
2
of the 1990 level.
Ukraine ranks first among the 45 Parties of the
Annex I to the UNFCCC in achieving GHG
emissions reduction (excluding the LULUCF sector)
and fourth in achieving GHG emissions reduction
including the LULUCF sector as compared to 1990.
Thus, Ukraine's GHG emissions reduced on 62.4%
from the 1990 level (including LULUCF) and on8
64.8% from the 1990 level (excluding LULUCF).
Further GHG emissions reduction in Ukraine is
possible through the implementation of structural
sectoral reforms and transformations, that will also
ensure sustainable economic growth.
In particular, this means completing the structural
changes of the energy markets. Liberalization of the
gas and electricity markets contributes towards the
implementation of policies on energy efficiency and
investments in renewable energy.
Today 63 % of electricity generated in Ukraine is
low-carbon in terms of GHG emissions. This is
achieved both through the high share of nuclear and
hydro generation and by increasing the share of
renewable energy.
Further decarbonisation of energy sector depends on
the efficiency of energy markets and their full
integration into the EU markets within the
framework of the Association Agreement between
the European Union and the European Atomic
Energy Community and their member states, of the
one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, and within
the framework of the Agreement on the
Establishment of the Energy Community with
Ukraine.
GHG emissions reduction has also a significant
social aspect associated with just transition of coal
regions as well as thermal energy generation.
Ukrainian economy is export-dependent. 48% of
GDP is generated from the export of goods and
services. For the modernization of the industrial
sector it is important to preserve and increase access
of Ukrainian goods to foreign markets, including the
markets of the EU countries.
Taking into account the great deterioration of the
main assets of large enterprises, modernization of the
economy and ensuring sustainable economic
development depends on the inflow of investments
from both private sources and international financial
institutions. According to estimations, the amount of9
capital investments until 2030, necessary for the
implementation of the NDC is 102 billion euro.
Access to investments mainly depends on the
macrofinancial stability of Ukraine. After the
dramatic crisis of 2014-2015, Ukraine was able to
restore its macrofinancial stability, but still depends
on the support of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
In spite of the national circumstances, Ukraine aims
to continue reducing GHG emissions, energy
intensity of GDP and achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals.
Over the past few years, Ukraine has started to
actively implement energy efficiency and
environmental protection policies and promote
economic modernization. In particular, such key
legislative and regulatory acts were adopted:
- Concept and Action plan for state climate
change policy implementation until 2030;
- Low emission development strategy of
Ukraine till 2050;
- Law of Ukraine “On basics of monitoring,
reporting and verification of GHG emissions”;
- Law of Ukraine “On ozone depleting
substances and fluorinated greenhouse gases”;
- Energy Strategy of Ukraine until 2035;
- National Transport Strategy of Ukraine until
2030;
- National Waste Management Strategy of
Ukraine until 2030;
- National Economic Strategy until 2030.
It is worth noting the positive experience of
conducting a detailed modelling of the country's
economy system. The modelling covered all
Best practices and
economic sectors and made it possible to analyse
experience related to the
different scenarios of economic development, the
preparation of the nationally
impact of existing climate and energy plans and
determined contribution;
strategies, as well as additional necessary policies
and measures.
The process of NDC preparation is characterized by10
inclusiveness and openness for discussion and
comments with the involvement of stakeholders and
the public at all stages.
The central executive bodies were also involved in
the working group at all stages of the process of
NDC preparation, which positively influenced the
further negotiation of the document.

6. How the Party considers that its NDC is fair and ambitious in light of its
national circumstances
Ukraine has made a significant contribution to the
reduction of global GHG emissions and ranks first
among the 45 Parties to the UNFCCC Annex I for
the achieved GHG emissions reduction excluding the
LULUCF sector and fourth for the level of GHG
emissions reduction including the LULUCF. During
the 11 years of Ukraine's obligations under the Kyoto
Protocol to the UNFCCC (from 2008 to 2018),
How the Party considers
Ukraine has totally reduced its GHG emissions by
that its NDC is fair and
nearly 4.4 billion tons of CO equivalent compared to
ambitious in the light of its 2
the permitted levels of emissions during this period,
national circumstances
which is close to 10% of the current annual global
emissions.
At the same time, Ukraine's overall economic and
social development since 1990 has been marked by a
decline in population wellbeing, de-industrialization
and deterioration of public finances.
At the same time, the low level of income leads to16
the use and purchase of used consumer goods and
equipment, comparing to more climate friendly and
expensive goods and technologies.
The implementation of the NDC goals by 2030 is
consistent with the completion of structural reforms
in many spheres of economy and social life.
Ukraine’s NDC provides for further reduction of
GHG emissions, taking into account the previous
significant reductions, in the conditions of ensuring
economic development, and is ambitious and
relevant, allowing implementation of climate policy
in the context of all the Sustainable Development
Goals.
The military aggression of the Russian Federation
and its temporarily occupation of the Autonomous
Republic of Crimea, the city of Sevastopol, as well as
certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions require
the involvement of significant political, financial and
human resources to protect the territorial integrity
and sovereignty of Ukraine and have a significant
negative impact on the economic situation in
Ukraine.
The foundation for achieving the NDC is linked to
the transformation of the energy sector, the success
of which depends on support provided to the
Government of Ukraine on:
- implementation of the National plan on reduction of
emissions from large combustion plants;
- integration of the unified energy system of Ukraine
into the energy system of continental Europe
(ENTSO-E);
- construction of up to 2 GW of peak and semi-peak
shunting heat generation and 0.5 GW of frequency
control support systems;
- generation of nuclear energy in the amount of not
less than 50% of the primary energy supply, taking
into account the need to build new power units;
- maintaining the transit of natural gas through the
territory of Ukraine in the amount of 40-55 billion m317
per year and preventing the completion of the Nord
Stream 2 project as such, which poses a threat to the
energy security of Ukraine and the EU;
- overcoming energy poverty of consumers;
- significant increase in the share of electricity and
heat production from renewable sources;
- full-scale implementation of the program on just
transition of coal regions.
Such support should complement declared program
of support to Ukraine in the Joint Statement of the
United States and Germany on “Support for Ukraine,
European Energy Security, and our Climate Goals”.
Modelling results indicate that under the scenario
""Business as usual"" GHG emissions are projected to
increase by 19% in 2030 as compared with the
current level. As Ukraine is suffering from various
economic and security crises from 2014, the
continued underinvestment can potentially lead to
increase of GHG emissions within the timeframe
(10 years) up to 37-42% of GHG emissions
compared to 1990. In contrast, the NDC predicts a
6.6% reduction of GHG emissions in 2030 compared
to the current level (2019).
The NDC target of 65% emissions reduction
economy-wide, compared to 1990 level, is
achievable for all sectors of the economy under the
following conditions:
- preserving access to foreign markets of key trade
partners,
- stable and predictable trade policy and the absence
of restrictions and barriers from the Annex I Parties
to UNFCCC and other countries, which might
introduce similar restrictions and barriers,
- access to financing for climate modernization
projects from the developed countries, private sector,
international financial institutions and other donors.
The amount of additional investment necessary to
deviate from the ""Business as usual"" scenario and18
achieve the NDC’s target is 102 billion euro.
Access to finance also depends on the strengthening
of macrofinancial stability of Ukraine, which is
currently implementing the program of cooperation
with the International Monetary Fund.
By implementing such an ambitious NDC in the
period up to 2030, Ukraine will be able to solve the
significantly larger investments needed to achieve a
climate-neutral economy in 2060.
Taking into account limited access of Ukraine to
international climate financing (in particular to Green
Climate Fund), Ukraine expects to receive additional
climate financing in the form of grants from
developed countries and other donors, soft loans and
other financial instruments for the purpose of
creation of a separate climate fund and increase
funding for the decarbonisation of the economy
through commercial banks and the private sector.
The lack of necessary international support puts on
the risk of achieving the goal of the NDC.

1.0 Background
This document presents the provisional communication of the updated Nationally Determined
Contribution (NDC) for Zambia to the Paris Agreement on climate change. Pursuant to
Decision 1/CP.19, 1/CP.20, and 1/CP.21, requesting countries to enhance their climate
ambitions and update their Nationally Determined Contributions from 2020 and every five
years thereafter, Zambia submits its updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0)
to the Paris Agreement on climate change. This submission is a critical step in Zambia's efforts
to address climate change and contribute to the global efforts of limiting global warming to
well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
Zambia's first NDC (NDC 1.0) was submitted on December 9, 2016, with a conditional pledge
to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 20,000 Gg CO2 eq. by 2030 against a base
year of 2010 under the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario with limited international support,
or by 38,000 Gg CO2 eq.) with substantial international support1. This pledge consisted of both
mitigation and adaptation components based on Zambia's national circumstances, including its
development priorities and economic growth prospects.
The country submitted its revised NDC 2.0 on July 30, 2021, outlining updated climate action
commitments, including targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing climate
resilience. While NDC 2.0 maintained the country’s overall pledge of reducing GHG emissions
by 20, 000 Gg CO2eq. by 2030 against the base year of 2010 under the Business-As-Usual
(BAU) scenario with limited international support, or, by 38 000 Gg CO2eq. with substantial
international support, it broadened the scope of sectors under mitigation by adding transport,
liquid waste, and coal (production, transportation, and consumption). This expansion was
based on a thorough review of Zambia's national circumstances and the need to address the
growing emissions from these sectors. Further, the submission elaborated the adaptation
component of the NDC by developing indicators that will enable the country track progress on
building resilience in both the human and physical systems and on adaptation actions. In this
NDC 3.0 submission, Zambia enhances its ambition by broadening the scope of sectors to
include:
Tourism: Zambia recognizes the importance of tourism in its economy and the need to promote
1 Limited international support means the domestic resources that the country is able to mobilize including the
prevailing international resources (Business as Usual resources) that the country was receiving as of 2015 and
estimated at USD $ 15 Billion. 2 Substantial international support means adequate international resources, both
bilateral and multilateral support estimated at USD $ 35 Billion.sustainable tourism infrastructure and practices that reduce GHG emissions.
Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU): This sector includes emissions from cement
production, which is a significant contributor to Zambia's GHG emissions.
Infrastructure (Green Buildings): Zambia aims to promote green building practices that reduce
energy consumption and and subsequently reduce GHG emissions.
Water security: Zambia aims to promote water security for all its citizens through gender-
responsive and climate-smart water infrastructure.
With the addition of these four sectors, Zambia has enhanced its ambition through a total of
ten (10) sectors comprising: Forestry (sustainable forest management), Agriculture
(sustainable agriculture), Energy (renewable energy and energy efficiency), Transport, Coal
(production, transportation and consumption), Waste, Infrastructure (Green buildings),
Tourism (Eco-Tourism) and Industrial Processes and Products Use (Cement Production) and
water security. This is progressively moving the country towards an economy-wide approach
in its coverage.
Zambia adopts the indicators from the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience and
Adaptation as a basis for enhancing its ambition in adaptation (Annex 2). The country has
developed complementary indicators on cross-cutting initiatives. These indicators include:
• Strengthened Institutional Capacity for Coordinating Climate Change Projects and
Programmes
• Fiscal policies improved to foster low-carbon and resilient sustainable development
• Financial stability and supervisory policy and procedures improved to foster low-
carbon and resilient sustainable development
Zambia's updated NDC 3.0 demonstrates its commitment to enhancing its climate ambitions
and contributing to the global effort to address climate change. The country's efforts to broaden
the scope of sectors under mitigation and adaptation will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and enhance climate resilience.

7(c) How the Party has taken into Zambia has taken a comprehensive approach to enhance its Nationally Determined
consideration paragraph 31(c) and (d) of Contribution (NDC) in line with paragraph 31(c) and (d) of decision 1/CP.21. This
decision 1/CP.21 involves broadening the scope of sectors under mitigation and adaptation to include
cement production under the Industrial Production and Product Use (IPPU) and
sustainable waste management. Additionally, other sectors added include infrastructure
and tourism, in addition to the existing sectors of agriculture, transport, forestry and
energy, and mining. This expansion brings the total number of sectors to ten,
demonstrating Zambia's commitment to addressing greenhouse gas emissions from all
relevant sectors and sub sectors. IPPU has been included due to its significant reduction
potential in the mineral industry, in particular, cement production.
Para. 31(c) “Parties strive to include all Zambia has strengthened its NDC by expanding the scope of sectors and sub-sectors

4 Planning processes:
(a) Information on the planning processes In preparing this provisional NDC 3.0 the government of Zambia conducted an NDC stock take
that the Party undertook to prepare its to establish level of implementation of its previous NDC. A multisectoral technical working
nationally determined contribution and, if group was established which reviewed the NDC stock take and integrated the findings into this
available, on the Party’s implementation provisional NDC 3.0 document. Other processes included incorporating findings from the
plans, including, as appropriate: reports of the NDC Implementation Framework, draft Biennial Transparency Report, Green
Growth Strategy, National Adaptation Plan (NAP), NDC implementation Framework, Nature
People Climate Investment Plan, Green Economy and Climate Change Act, 8th National
Development Plan and the Carbon stock take for Zambia.
Zambia will embark on the revision of the National Policy of Climate Change 2016; The review
of the NDC implementation Framework is currently being conducted with the view to access the
9progress made in the implementation of priority mitigation adaptation and cross cutting actions.
The National Designated Authority (NDA) for the Green Climate Fund has already been
designated and is expected to play a key role of “clearing house or entity” for climate change
projects to be funded from GCF in Zambia. The NDA for Green Climate Fund is serving as the
National Designated entity (NDE) for the Adaptation Fund.
The Zambia National Commercial Bank (ZANACO) was recently accredited as the National
Implementing Entity (NIE) for Direct Access under the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and through
the Green Economy and Climate Change Act, the country is in the process of establishing a
Green Economy and Climate Change Fund (GECCF) with the purposes of increasing the number
institutions for resource mobilization and accreditation as national implementing entities.
This provisional updated NDC was done with broad stakeholder participation with stakeholders
including Government institutions, civil society, private sector and academia, while ensuring
gender balance in the process. The effectiveness of the NDC implementation will be ensured
through the ongoing development of the revised NDC implementation Framework, NDC
Investment Plan and NDC Capacity Building programme. Furthermore, strengthening of
Implementation will be done by the development and operationalization of the Framework for
Monitoring Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems to track progress of implementation of
both the mitigation and adaptation programs and Carbon Registry which will track all the
Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs). The NDC Implementation Plan
Online Tool is currently being used to monitor and report on the implementation of the NDC as
indicated in the implementation framework activities.
10(i) Domestic institutional arrangements, Institutional arrangements: The Institutional arrangements for climate change
public participation and engagement implementation is established in the Green Economy and Climate Change Act of 2024
with local communities and indigenous through an inter-ministerial coordination structure. The Act establishes the Council of
peoples, in a gender-responsive manner Ministers chaired by the Vice President of the country, which is the supreme decision-
making body in overseeing Climate Change interventions in the country. It provides policy
guidance on climate change programming, mainstreaming, resource mobilization,
monitoring and evaluation.
The Technical Committee on Climate Change comprises representatives from relevant
Ministries and a broad range of other stakeholders, including private sector, civil society,
financial institutions, among others. The Committee is the main technical advisory body to
the Council of Ministers and is chaired by the Ministry responsible for Climate Change
implementation under which there is a dedicated department on climate change which is
responsible for coordinating climate change implementation in Zambia. The technical
committee is also serving as the Designated National Authority for carbon markets and
trading.
The Zambia Environmental Management Agency, responsible for preparing national GHG
inventories, Biennial Transparency Reports and National Communications, will also serve
as the host for the National Carbon Registry. Sub-National structures to coordinate climate
change implementation at the sub-national will follow the established national coordination
structures under the development plans.
Public participation and engagement: Public participation and engagement with local
communities and in a gender-responsive manner. The stock take exercise involved sub
national stakeholder engagement including assessing the contribution of community-based
mitigation and adaptation initiatives.
11The NDC stock take process was conducted using a national wide approach to reach those at
the heart of implementation of various projects on climate change. All the Ten Provinces of
the country were visited to obtain the necessary primary data that informed the NDC stock
take exercise. The informants included representatives of local communities and subnational
leaders. Government conducted awareness and capacity building programs targeting youth
involvement in the NDC processes in all the Ten provinces. Processes are currently under
way to conduct more technical studies that will inform the final NDC 3.0. The studies will
ensure comprehensive engagement of local communities, sub-national leaders using a gender
responsive approach.
(ii) a. Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as Zambia has a total surface area of 752,614 km2 out of which 99 percent is made up of land
appropriate: National circumstances, area and one percent is covered by water. In 2022, the country’s population was estimated at
such as geography, climate, economy, 19,610,769, with approximately 60 percent living in rural areas. Further, about 64.3 percent
sustainable development and poverty of the population (in 2022) lived on less than US$2.15 a day. Additionally, a rise in urban
eradication poverty from 23.4 percent to 31.9 percent remains a key highlight of the country’s poverty
assessment in the context of weak macroeconomic performance and a succession of negative
shocks. In 2023, Zambia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.8 percent compared to
3.9 percent in 2000. This economic growth rate was largely driven by agriculture and
infrastructure developments. Zambia’s agricultural sector is the socio-economic backbone
12of the rural population, with 60 percent being dependent on the sector as the main source of
income and livelihood.
It has been projected that climate change impacts could slow the development process of the
country and could cost Zambia, as the country would be losing huge volumes of money in
terms of GDP). In order to prevent economic losses resulting from impacts of climate
change, the Government of Zambia (GRZ) has integrated climate change concerns in its
policies, programmes, plans and strategies to support a low carbon and climate-resilient
development pathway and the attainment of the middle-income status envisioned in the
country’s Vision 2030.
The majority of rural households are smallholder farmers who are dependent on rainfed
agriculture with limited access to finance for mechanization and irrigation. While the sector
offers pathways out of poverty, challenges are exacerbated by the increased frequency of
extreme weather events such as rainfall variation, floods that have hampered the growth of
agriculture among smallholder farmers and recurrent droughts caused by climate change. In
2023/24, Zambia experienced the driest agriculture season in more than forty years. The
drought adversely affected surface water levels, crop and pasture production for an estimated
6,552,027 people, translating into 1,092,005 farming households across the country. The
drought was caused by the late onset and prolonged dry spells associated with the El Nino
phenomenon which has negatively affected crop production. This comes against the back-
drop of at least 2.04 million people who are already severely food insecure and in need of
humanitarian assistance beyond the end of the lean season. In addition, the spillover effects
of the Covid-19 pandemic meant additional to the demands of humanitarian responses by
the government. Approximately 1.1 million households in 84 Districts across 8 provinces
were affected. This represents a population of 6.6 million as being in critical need of
assistance. The government of Zambia estimated the required resources at US$941 Million
as the total funding requirement to respond to the drought emergence.
13b. Best practices and experience related to the b. The multisectoral institutional framework for coordinating climate change which is
preparation of the nationally determined described under Section 4 (a) (i) in this document is a good practice for handling a cross-
contribution cutting issue like climate change.
Zambia conducted a countrywide risk vulnerability assessment (CVA) to arrive at
scenarios for enhancing adaptation measures. The CVA informed the preparations of
the country's NDC implementation framework and national adaptation plan. The NDC
stocktake and the GHG inventory exercise have been critical to informing the country
of progress made on reducing GHG emissions. These practices have been critical to
the preparations of Zambia’s NDC.
The development of the NDC and carbon stocktake to inform the NDC revision is one
of the best practices followed in the preparation of this provisional NDC. Furthermore,
the constitution of the Technical Working Group composed of sector experts to update
the NDC has also worked as an emerging good practice.
As a Least Developed Country (LDC), Zambia has flexibility in submitting its Biennial
Transparency Report and plans to submit a combined BTR1/NC4 in 2025. This
submission will help inform substantive revisions to the NDC.
Achieving the aspirations of the National Development Plan and sustainable

Other contextual aspirations and
development goals requires substantial financial and technical assistance. Zambia’s
priorities acknowledged when joining the

country's capacity for enhancing ambition for climate action. Therefore, it is
anticipated that the Paris Agreement will provide a mechanism for reducing the cost
of financing climate change. Furthermore, the Paris Agreement is one of the important
mechanisms for achieving gender equality by supporting the differently abled and the
youths affected by the impacts of climate change. Additionally, climate change offers
14opportunities for enhancing investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency
technologies, nature-based solutions, and climate-smart projects.

19(e) Adaptation An In-depth countrywide Vulnerability Assessment was conducted in 2020 to provide an
assessment and analysis of the effect of dry spells, floods and pest infestation on different
sectors in order to understand their impacts on sector performance and recommend
required actions for response, rehabilitation and recovery. It outlines recommendations for
the following sectors: Agriculture and food security; Health; Nutrition; Water, Sanitation
and Hygiene; Education; and Development Project and Safety net programmes being
implemented in communities. This Vulnerability Assessment was updated upon in 2023
to assess the vulnerability of agroecological regions and geographical regions to climate
induced hazards such as droughts and floods. This vulnerability assessment informed the
development of the National Adaptation Plan. Additionally, another vulnerability
Assessment will be conducted to assess the vulnerability of the microclimate system in
the country on various sectors. This vulnerability assessment will provide critical
information to the NDC preparation.
Preliminary indicators for tracking progress on adaptation are provided in Annex 2.
5 Assumptions and methodological approaches, including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions and, as appropriate, removals:
(a) Assumptions and methodological Zambia prepared its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventories for the Third National
approaches used for accounting for Communication (TNC) and Biennial Update Report (BUR) using the 2006 IPCC
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions Guidelines, which informed the revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)
and removals corresponding to the baseline. As a Least Developed Country (LDC), Zambia has flexibility in submitting its
Party’s nationally determined Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) under Decision 18/CMA.1 and plans to submit a
contribution, consistent with decision combined BTR1/NC4 in 2025. This report will follow the 2016 IPCC Guidelines,
1/CP.21, paragraph 31, and accounting including the 2019 Refinement, and cover a GHG inventory time series from 1990 to
20guidance adopted by the CMA 2022. Additionally, it will track progress toward NDC targets and provide details on
financial, technological, and capacity-building support needs and support provided for
implementation of its NDC. Accounting information will align with Decision 4/CMA.1,
and methodologies will follow Decision 5/CMA.3.
Final accounting towards the target, that will take place in 2032, may depend on resource
availability. Zambia is also participating in the market-based mechanisms on emission
reductions as a way of raising its ambitions.

the Tier 1 method was used for the remaining subcategories under AFOLU.
The baseline greenhouse gas emission projections for the energy sector involved an analysis of energy
demand trends and GHG emissions during the period 2010-2050. The Long-range Energy Alternatives
Planning System (LEAP) was used to assess the projected energy demand and GHG emissions.
For the Industrial Processes and Product Use sector, emission projections were determined using carbon
intensity derived from historical emissions. Emissions projections for Livestock and aggregate sources
and non-CO2 emission sources on land categories were undertaken based on emissions per capita. The
projected emissions were calculated as a product of per capita emissions and projected human
population.
Baseline emissions projections for Land (forest land, crop land, grassland, and settlements) were
determined by applying an annual deforestation rate of 0.7% to the historical baseline emissions. The
Tier 2 method was employed for the Land subcategory and livestock under AFOLU, while the Tier 1
method was used for Aggregate sources and non-CO2 emissions.
Emissions projections for Waste categories were undertaken based on emissions per capita. The
projected emissions were calculated as a product of per capita emissions and projected human
23population.
A baseline projection for transport was calculated by assuming that the percent of Zambia's total
emissions attributed to freight will reach current average levels in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) region (scaled by population) in 2050. The annual growth rates required for this
transition were then calculated, and this growth rate (8.85% per annum) was applied to the 2016
inventory emissions and projected out to 2050.
A baseline projection for forest land was calculated based on the technical assessment of the proposed
forest reference emission level of Zambia submitted in 2021. Zambia's Forest Reference Emission
Level (FREL) was developed using methodologies consistent with the IPCC guidelines, particularly
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
The FREL relied on a variety of data sources, including national forest inventories, satellite data,
government reports, and research studies. Models played a key role in estimating emissions and
projecting future trends. The net CO2 emissions were calculated as the sum of emissions and removals,
using the current deforestation rate of 0.7% to project forward the changes in emissions and removals.
A baseline projection for cropland was calculated by using a population growth rate to determine the
projected CO2 emissions. A population growth rate of 2.9% up to 2030 and then a lower growth rate
of 2.48% for the period 2030-2050 was assumed. Population data was obtained from World meter
(2021).
A baseline projection for waste was calculated by assuming that the currently low amount of waste
generation per capita increases with GDP and that the total amount of waste increases with population.
Furthermore, it was assumed that the currently low rate of collection and landfilling of waste increases
up to 80% by 2050.

fair and ambitious in the light of its become a low carbon and climate resilient prosperous middle-income country by 2030. Zambia is a
national circumstances low contributor to the global greenhouse gas emission. In developing the NDC, Zambia considered
the general principles and provisions of the Convention and the Paris Agreement, especially those
related to Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) and
equitable access to atmospheric space.
The country’s NDC is guided by the Vision 2030 and the 8th National Development Plan, and it
desires to reduce poverty, deforestation, forest degradation, improved energy access. To increase
the adaptive capacity to droughts, floods and extreme temperatures. The country desires to attain a
low carbon, climate-resilient and socially inclusive sustainable economic growth through
sustainable development and a prosperous middle-income nation by 2030 in line with the country’s
Vision 2030.
The successful implementation of Zambia’s NDC is dependent on the level of support to be provided
through the Convention and other multilateral and bilateral arrangements.
